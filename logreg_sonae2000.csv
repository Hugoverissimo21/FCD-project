""Um pé no travão e outro no acelerador"" ""O mercado de capitais já foi extremamente importante para financiar as empresas, mas neste momento não serve para nada."" A afirmação é de Belmiro de Azevedo, presidente da Sonae, que estende esta apreciação às bolsas europeias, sustentando-a na divergência entre as cotações e o valor real das empresas. ""Para se recorrer ao mercado de capitais tem de haver uma relação razoável entre o valor económico e o valor financeiro das empresas. Neste momento, o económico não é traduzido de forma equivalente no mercado financeiro"", sublinha o patrão da Sonae. Belmiro de Azevedo, que foi abordado pelo jornalistas à saída do seminário ""Integração Regional e Globalização"", promovido pela Comissão de Coordenação da Região Norte, recusou-se a comentar rumores de uma eventual retirada da Bolsa da Sonae Indústria e da Sonae.Com, bem como sobre a hipótese de a Sonae SGPS ser cotada na Europa. Quanto às contas semestrais do grupo, anteontem apresentadas, o empresário desvalorizou o aumento do endividamento, salientando que ""do lado do activo o património cresceu ainda mais"". ""Se quisessemos baixar o endividamento fazíamos um saldo, coisa que não queremos fazer"", sublinhou o empresário, acrescentando que esta é uma forma de financiamento legítima que ""está sempre sob controlo"". E lembrou que ""ter sempre um pé no travão e outro no acelerador"" é a sua forma de estar no mundo dos negócios há mais de 30 anos. Belmiro de Azevedo recusou, também, responder se tenciona vender a área da distribuição no Brasil, referindo apenas que ""a Sonae tem uma atitude dinâmica e normalmente uma maior propensão para comprar do que para vender"". O empresário negou, ainda, que a entrada do Carrefour na Modelo Continente (resultante da fusão com a Promodés) constitua um problema. ""Não há ninguém insatisfeito porque nos ignoramos mutuamente"", disse. Copyright © 1995,2001 Diário de Notícias, SA Todos os direitos reservados webmaster@DnOnline"

Ao referir-se ao debate de quarta-feira, falou em ""palavras novas"" para ""ideias velhas"". E reagiu com um simples ""registei"" à hipótese de entendimento sugerida na SIC por Nogueira. Mais contactos com agentes económicos nortenhos e menos manifestações populares dominaram o dia de ontem de campanha portuense do presidente do PP, Manuel Monteiro. Primeiro com Belmiro de Azevedo, depois com a Associação Industrial Portuense (AIP), Monteiro dedicou o dia ao debate da política económica. A excepção aconteceu em Gondomar, onde a caravana do PP teve que suportar a provocação social-democrata. Logo pela manhã, Monteiro reuniu com Belmiro de Azevedo para falar ""daquilo que é preciso fazer para alterar a maneira como o país é governado, para educar e formar melhor as pessoas e gerir melhor os dinheiros públicos"", segundo afirmou, no final do encontro, o ""patrão"" da Sonae. ""Não discutimos as ideias do PP"", afirmou Belmiro de Azevedo. Para Manuel Monteiro, tratou-se de uma reunião ""muitíssimo importante"" para o PP, na qual, foram trocadas ""ideias muito claras e objectivas sobre o desenvolvimento económico, social e político de Portugal"". O contacto deixava antever um ""bom início de dia"", de acordo com o prognóstico do próprio Monteiro. Mas o dia do PP não correu da melhor forma. Ainda durante a manhã, a caravana popular dirigiu-se à feira semanal de Gondomar para cumprir mais um ritual de campanha. Uma comitiva menos alegre do que aquela que, no dia anterior, havia percorrido os mercados do Porto, acompanhou Monteiro por uma feira pouco frequentada e onde alguns apoiantes do PSD insistiram em afrontar a caravana do PP. E até a música debitada pelos altifalantes ""laranja"" - ""O bicho"" - parecia ter sido escolhida para provocar os Populares que, recorde-se, têm utilizado na sua campanha aquele tema elevado a ""hit"". De tenda em tenda, Monteiro provou azeitonas, comeu uma sardinha frita e ainda teve tempo para comprar uma camisa. ""Trouxe uma a menos"", justificou Monteiro, ao mesmo tempo que desembolsava mil e quinhentos escudos. Ao início da tarde, Monteiro voltou às reuniões com os empresários, desta vez, com a AIP. O presidente da associação, Ludgero Marques, não participou no encontro - está ausente nos Estados Unidos - que contou com presença de vários ""vices"" da AIP, como Couto dos Santos e Manuel Violas. No final do encontro, Monteiro voltou a manifestar o seu contentamento: ""Não teria sido possível manter este tipo de contactos há três anos"" quando o líder do PP assumiu a presidência do partido. No dia em que Monteiro contou com a presença de Manuel Queiró - simbolicamente, o último da lista do PP no Porto - o presidente do PP teve ainda tempo para falar do último debate televisivo entre Nogueira e Guterres durante o qual considera que ""procurou-se falar de forma nova, com palavras novas, apresentando ideias velhas"". Quanto a eventuais coligações, tal qual foi sugerido pelo presidente do PSD, Monteiro limita-se a um lacónico: ""Registei!"" Noticias do Mês de Setembro SECÇÃO ARTIGO"

14,1,24,0.8107582631237849,0,3086,23,"DN   27 de Setembro de 2001 Sonae com aliado na Portucel Grupo português estabeleceu parceria com brasileiros da Suzano, ainda dependente de autorização das autoridades locais. Mas a CMVM desconfia que houve problemas na comunicação ao mercado Ilídia Pinto Márcio Alves Candoso AP-John Moore PARCERIA. A Suzano vai acompanhar Belmiro na corrida à Portucel, permitindo à Sonae uma poupança significativa A CMVM está a investigar a Sonae, por alegadamente esta se ter atrasado na publicação de um ""facto relevante"". A Sonae SGPS anunciou ontem a celebração de um acordo com a brasileira Suzano tendo em vista ""o reforço da participação actualmente detida na Portucel e a apresentação de uma proposta ao concurso público da segunda fase de reprivatização da sociedade"", previsto para o primeiro trimestre de 2002. Mas no dia anterior, no Brasil, a empresa agora associada a Belmiro de Azevedo tinha feito anúncio semelhante, noticiado em diversas agências internacionais. O facto levou a um disparo da cotação da Sonae, logo na abertura do mercado, que impôs até uma interrupção de negociação para consolidação de ofertas, dado que o título tinha subido 15 %. Segundo o DN apurou, a Sonae só emitiu o comunicado em que refere a aliança com a Suzano após solicitação da CMVM. O acordo pressupõe a aquisição, por parte da companhia brasileira, de 49,99 % da Sonae Produtos e Derivados Florestais (SPDF), por via de um aumento de capital. A SPDF detém a totalidade da Sonae Wood Products, BV, detentora, por seu turno, de 18,01 % do capital da Portucel (valor anterior ao aumento de capital em curso). A conclusão da transacção está dependente ""do cumprimento de certas condições"", nomeadamente ""a autorização do investimento da Suzano pelo Banco Central do Brasil e a aquisição de uma posição de domínio da Portucel em resultado do concurso de reprivatização"". A Sonae manterá o domínio da SPDF (50,01 %). ""Esta associação estratégica é expressão do empenho da Sonae na criação de condições que permitam a transferência do domínio da Portucel para o controlo de capitais maioritariamente portugueses e na procura de alianças que aportem contributos importantes à gestão da fileira florestal e aos negócios da celulose e papel"", acrescenta o comunicado. Refere ainda que a Suzano, através da sua participada Bahia Sul Celulose, é titular no Brasil de ""relevantes activos"" neste sector, ""pelo que a sua associação à Sonae neste projecto permitirá à Portucel beneficiar de elevadas sinergias"". A Agência Financeira avançava ontem que a Suzano ""pagou 130 milhões de euros (cerca de 26 milhões de contos) para adquirir os 49,99 % da SPDF, montante que corresponde aos 10 % adquiridos no recente aumento de capital da Portucel"". Após a conclusão do acordo e a privatização da Portucel, o grupo agora formado poderá exceder os 50% do capital da pasteira, o que implicará o lançamento de OPA. Por outro lado, a associação com a Suzano permite à Sonae um menor esforço de investimento na corrida à Portucel.

Em declarações à Agência Financeira, o presidente da Carrefour em Portugal, Gerard Vinson, afirma que com a situação actual da empresa na Bolsa ""não há condições para vender"". No entanto, Vinson diz estar ""à espera"" que Belmiro de Azevedo faça uma proposta de compra, estando disponível para analisar todos os cenários com o Grupo Sonae. A Carrefour detém a participação de 21 % na Modelo Continente desde a fusão com a Promodés, empresa que era sócia e parceira inicial da Sonae nos hipermercados Continente. Desde o início do ano, as acções da Modelo Continente caíram 45 %, cotando-se hoje nos 1,2 euros. O presidente da Carrefour declarou ainda que não incomoda à empresa deter a posição na Modelo Continente, afirmando que a situação é ""mais desconfortável para a Sonae"". ""Por enquanto não há nenhuma razão particular para vender. É uma boa participação e dá lucros"", acrescentou Gerard Vinson. A Carrefour prevê a abertura de uma nova loja todos os anos, com a unidade de Loures a ser inaugurada no final de 2002 e a do Montijo no início de 2003.

A Vila Expo disponibiliza 725 novos fogos terminados e já ocupados por representantes dos diferentes países e organizações participantes. À Sonae foi concedida licença para edificação de uma vasta estrutura de habitação e lazer, um investimento de 28 milhões de contos que compreende o futuro Centro Comercial Vasco da Gama, com 217 lojas instaladas em quatro andares, e duas torres de habitação, a São Rafael e a São Gabriel. Para além destes, existem ainda núcleos habitacionais desenvolvidos por promotores privados na zona da marina e no centro de negócios. Hotelaria No sector hoteleiro, o Hotel Meliá Confort Oriente, com 116 quartos, é a única unidade já concluída e completamente reservada para o período expositivo. Atrasado está o Hotel Ásia Internacional, investimento próximo dos 3 milhões de contos a cargo de um grupo de empresários macaenses, com cerca de 300 quartos. Embora com a fachada já concluída, os acabamentos necessários não estarão prontos a tempo da abertura da Exposição. Com construção prevista apenas para o período pós-expositivo está o Hotel Crown Plaza De Luxe, da rede Holiday Inn, direccionado para a zona da marina. Para além destes, prevê-se ainda a edificação de uma unidade hoteleira junto ao Parque Urbano, a aguardar possíveis interessados. Ambiente Cerca de um terço dos 330 hectares ao longo dos quais se estende o Plano de Urbanização estão reservados a espaços verdes, o que equivale a uma área superior a 110 relvados de futebol. Foram plantadas até ao momento cerca de 6,5 mil árvores - um número que se prevê subir até às 20 mil -, ao mesmo tempo que prosseguem os trabalhos de instalação de sistemas de rega e drenagem. É para o Parque do Tejo e do Trancão que se destina grande parte das áreas verdes previstas para a zona de intervenção. Espaço com cerca de 84 hectares anteriormente ocupado por um enorme aterro industrial, o futuro parque urbano de Lisboa será ocupado com áreas de recreio, desporto (estão previstos ""courts"" de ténis, um centro hípico e um campo de golfe) ou simples passeio. Nas antigas instalações petrolíferas do Cabo Ruivo, junto à porta sul, ficarão os sete hectares do Parque do Cabeço das Rolas, e já no interior do recinto expositivo está reservada uma área de um hectare para os Jardins Garcia de Orta. Previsto está também um Porto de Recreio, com capacidade para cerca de 700 embarcações, que se estende ao longo da antiga doca dos Olivais. Saúde No sector da saúde, o grosso do investimento cabe à seguradora Império, à qual foi concedida licença para a edificação do Hospital das Descobertas. Um investimento na ordem dos 4,5 milhões de contos que disponibilizará cerca de 200 novas camas. Definitivo é também o Centro de Assistência Principal de Saúde, preparado para acolher entre 24 mil e 30 mil utentes e com abertura prevista para 2000. A Sabiol e a Sipaco, farmacêuticas especializadas em produtos de veterinária, preparam-se para transferir para a zona de intervenção as respectivas sedes e armazéns. Educação No que toca à educação, e para além da Escola Básica Integrada Vasco da Gama, com construção já iniciada e inauguração prevista para 2000, foram atribuídas licenças às Escolas Superiores de Enfermagem (750 alunos) e de Tecnologias da Saúde (700 alunos) e ao jardim de infância ""Os Três Golfinhos"". As residências universitárias da Universidade Clássica de Lisboa (750 camas) e do Instituto Superior Técnico (250 camas, já disponíveis para alojamento durante o período da Exposição) e a Casa da Juventude de Lisboa estão também concessionadas. Um colégio privado com jardim de infância e ensinos primário e secundário é de igual modo esperado para o local. Comércio e serviços No sector terciário, núcleo de actividade mais representativo para a área, foram atribuídas licenças à Baviera (BMW) para a futura sede, à Imocom, responsável pelo edifício Infante, à Ford Lusitana, que irá dispor de um ""stand"" e instalações técnicas, e à Portugal Telecom, que preserva o seu edifício onde coabitam uma loja e uma central de telecomunicações. A proposta apresentada pela Mitsubishi aguarda um parecer favorável que, segundo a Expo Urbe, se encontra próximo. Na restauração, foram atribuídas concessões à Animacais, de Herman José, para a exploração de dois restaurantes durante 15 anos e a um restaurante da cadeia brasileira Chimarrão. A José Manuel Trigo foi atribuída licença para a exploração do restaurante no topo da Torre Vasco da Gama, situado a cerca de 100 metros de altura. Edifícios emblemáticos Sob o signo da cultura, também o destino dos designados ""edifícios emblemáticos"" da Expo começa a ganhar contornos definitivos. O Pavilhão dos Oceanos será transformado no futuro Oceanário de Lisboa, o maior da Europa e o mais moderno do mundo, que depois da Expo terá um espaço para exposições temporárias e um serviço educativo de apoio a visitas escolares. A Área Internacional Norte, local para onde estão previstos os pavilhões de cerca de 60 países participantes, transformar-se-á no novo Centro de Exposições de Lisboa, a futura FIL a ser gerida pela Associação Industrial Portuguesa e com exposições já agendadas para o primeiro trimestre de 1999. Com capacidade para 16 mil pessoas, o Pavilhão da Utopia - que se vai passar a designar Pavilhão Multiusos - será utilizado maioritariamente para congressos, actividades desportivas e concertos. Dúvidas subsistem ainda relativamente ao Pavilhão de Portugal - chegou a falar-se no futuro Museu das Descobertas - e ao Pavilhão do Conhecimento dos Mares, que após o encerramento da Expo deverá passar para a tutela do Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia. Pensa-se na sua futura utilização como Museu da Ciência de Lisboa. Em estudo está também a possibilidade da presidência do Conselho de Ministros, do Ministério da Cultura e de outros serviços e instituições governamentais serem transferidos para a zona da Expo.

Esta ""maioria"" poderá tirar tudo aos Portugueses? Acho que não!... Sem Título    Por: Luis Graça 2002-05-13 15:42:35 Vamos ser solidários com os nossos colegas da RTP e defender um serviço público de televisão com qualidade e regulador da actividade televisiva em Portugal, acima de tudo vamos dizer que não concordamos que o serviço publico seja feito em grupos privados com o dinheiro dos nossos impostos. Não podemos concordar com o fim da RTP Internacional, o único elo entre as comunidades emigrantes e Portugal. Não podemos esquecer que a actual situação financeira da RTP deve-se às políticas de Cavaco Silva que em 1992, à custa do dinheiro dos contribuintes portugueses e endividamento da RTP junto da Banca, resolveu ""oferecer"" a Moçambique, Angola, Cabo Verde, Guiné Bissaue São Tomé televisões públicas naqueles paises. Porquê que os portugueses tem que ser privados de televisão pública com mais qualidade que as privadas enquanto a oferecemos a outros paises? Finalmente, não podemos concordar que os canais privados emitam em prime time todo o tipo de programação ofensiva sem qualquer tipo de regulação por parte do estado - não é aceitável que as crianças sejam sujeitas a cenas de violência e ""shows de strip"" que tocam a pornografia. Vamos defender a nossa RTP, vamos exigir mais qualidade e vamos responsabilizar os governos pela má gestão das empresas públicas. Hoje é a RTP, e amanhã? a CP, a TAP, o Metro de Lisboa, a Carris, a Transtejo, os STCP do Porto, a SATA Air Açores? Tudo o que dá prejuizo fecha-se? O interesse público não conta? E as consequências sociais, os empregados destas empresas, o emprego indirecto que é gerado....não podemos esquecer que a grande maioria dos empregados da RTP são pessoas comuns com familias a seu cargo, empréstimos a pagar. Vamos ser solidários. SERVIÇO PÚBLICO SIM!    Por: Ana Cristina 2002-05-13 15:40:24 O Governo deve ter muitas dificuldades em interpretar o que significa SERVIÇO PÚBLICO DE TELEVISÃO para querer fazer a asneira de AMPUTAR um canal à RTP. O Governo PSD devia ter vergonha na cara quando fala em ""arrumar financeiramente a RTP"" ou será que querem branquear o facto de ter sido um Governo PSD QUE VENDEU A REDE DE RETRANSMISSORES POR TUTA E MEIA, obrigando a actual RTP a pagar milhões por aquilo que antes era seu por direito. O Governo é hipócrita quando fala em ""arrumar financeiramente a RTP"" e depois anuncia que a estação pública vai estar impedida de passar publicidade, certamente uma das suas maiores fontes de receitas. EXMOS. SRS. DO GOVERNO PSD: NÃO NOS ATIREM AREIA PARA OS OLHOS!!! SERVIÇO PÚBLICO DE TELEVISÃO SIM, PINTO BALSEMÃO NÃO! Comentários para que?    Por: Jose Nogueira 2002-05-13 15:36:04 Porque é que a RTP dá prejuizo, Sr. Ministro? Quanto deve o estado a RTP? O que é que se passou com o negocio das antenas retransmissoras, que foram ""dadas"" á PT? O fundo da questão é muito simples, e só um ""cego"" é que não vê, que no ano passado a estação do Sr. Balsemão deu um prejuizo louco, apesar da ""alta qualidade"" da sua programação, meus amigos abram os olhos que a verdadeira questão está nos cerca de 10 milhôes de contos em publicidade que são muito apeteciveis, bem como a licença da televisão digital que o Sr. Pais de Amaral deseja. RTP: passado, presente e FUTURO    Por: Brás Cruz 2002-05-13 15:36:02 (Texto publicado no forum do Portaldebolsa.com) Vamos então aprofundar o caso RTP um pouco mais: 1- MODELO DE SERVIÇO PÚBLICO: A RTP como serviço público só faz sentido se contar com dois canais, nos moldes mais ou menos em que está organizada actualmente, ou seja, com um canal generalista e outro de cariz eminentemente cultural, num sentido abrangente de cultura mas nunca com a expectativa de ser um canal de massas. O canal generalista tem que ser competitivo e regulador. Competitivo no sentido de que tem que ser atractivo para o grande público e servir de alternativa ao grosso dos telespectadores. Uma coisa no género de, por exemplo, se estiver a TVI a passar um qualquer Big Breda e a SIC a fazer marcação cerrada com um Bar da TV, o público possa, por exemplo, ter à mesma hora um Mau Tempo no Canal, um Conde de Abranhos, um interessante debate sobre um interessante tema ou um qualquer projecto novo do Moita Flores, porque esses já trazem garantia de qualidade e atracção. É isto que é ser regulador: apresentar produtos de qualidade que interessem ao grande público, provando com audiências razoáveis aos canais comerciais que não é indispensável descer ao mais baixo dos níveis para ganhar audiências (leia-se dinheiro). Não é bem isso que o Canal 1 faz actualmente, mas os ajustamentos até nem são muito significativos. O Canal 2 é uma reserva de cultura, informação e prazer estético que, infelizmente, ainda só atrai menos de 10% dos portugueses, mas que é indispensável para esses e como veículo de formação contínua de muitos outros. Há quem diga que este Canal 2 poderia ser, sozinho, serviço público, alienado-se o Canal 1. Errado - NÃO HÁ SERVIÇO PÚBLICO SEM PÚBLICO. Mais: a ser assim, ficava, de facto, muito mais barato explorar um Canal 2, mas o canal(ais) internacional(ais) subia em flecha nos custos, porque não haveria programas para o alimentar (a não ser o arquivo) e eles teriam que ser comprados para o efeito). 2- CUSTOS: O descalabro financeiro da RTP tem justificações tão fáceis que até dói. Primeiro, a falta de cumprimento dos seus compromissos por parte do Estado. O Estado encomenda (leia-se, obriga) à RTP canais internacionais, programas para confissões religiosas, tradução gestual, cobertura sistemática do chamado desporto amador, apoio ao cinema nacional e uma miríade de outros programas a actuações de serviço considerado público e, depois, não paga os custos contratualizados. O Estado deve à RTP 111 MILHÕES DE CONTOS, dívida acumulada ao longo de mais de uma década, enquanto que a RTP tem que recorrer ao crédito sucessivamente para sobreviver, chegando mesmo a contrair empréstimos para pagar juros de empréstimos! Depois há as gestões (leia-se gestores e apaniguados partidários) que os sucessivos governos lá vão colocando, com uma série de mordomias que se repetem a cada mudança de executivo e às vezes, apenas de ministro. Sai caro, sim senhor. Quanto ao pessoal, há (?) um excedente pouco significativo mas há, sobretudo uma inflação de chefias intermédias (lembro-me de uma reportagem do TAL&QUAL, aqui há 10 anos atrás, em que se dizia que a RTP (ou o Telejornal, não tenho a certeza) tinha 1 Chefe para cada 1,8 índios; é muita gente a mandar (acrescente-se: a ganhar mais e produzir menos), convenhamos. O outro responsável pelo estrangulamento da RTP foi o fim das taxas, sem que o Cavaco, e quem veio depois, garantissem a reposição desses montantes, associado, mais recentemente, à limitação da publicidade a 7,5 minutos em cada hora, contra 12 minutos dos privados. 3- ENTÃO, O QUE FAZER? a) Manter obviamente os dois canais nacionais, ajustando o que há a ajustar, 1 ou 2 internacionais (aqui já estou mais dividido), os Centros Regionais (no Continente e nas Regiões Autónomas), e assumir um de dois sistemas de financiamento: totalmente público (como escreve o Gatsby) seria o ideal, mas num tempo em que os governantes só vêem números, não me parece plausível. Então, resta a hipótese da livre concorrência do mercado e/ou o regresso à taxas, cobrindo o Estado apenas a diferença. Antes de (re)começar, sanear financeiramente a empresa, porque, para além de indispensável, é uma obrigação do Estado, que foi quem provocou o grosso do problema. b) Apostar na produção portuguesa sem cedências de mediocridade tipo novelas da TVI, sem virar costas a programas estrangeiros que tenham qualidade e despertem interesse. c) Continuar a ter um centro de formação que já foi o melhor da Europa e ainda hoje é uma referência, abrindo-o mesmo aos canais privados e outros operadores, mediante pagamento justo, claro. d) Instituir uma gestão profissional e independente, que não esteja absolutamente dependente das mudanças de Governos ou do humor dos governantes. A RTP tem (ainda hoje) os melhores e mais actualizados profissionais (nomeadamente na área técnica), tem bom equipamento, tem ""know how"" tem história e tem FUTURO. Assim o queiram. pedido    Por: cesar pires 2002-05-13 15:17:21 Sera´que algum dos vossos milionarios empregados me oferece 500 contitos para dar de entrada para um carrito, já que têm carrito que eu lhes ofereci, talvez uma alma de caridade me possa retribuir.

Quem vive em Portugal pode estar alheio ao que está por trás das boas intencões do actual governo. Querem igualar a todo o custo os países europeus, aplicar as mesmas politicas sem primeiro reflectir sobre a a real dimencão sociológica portuguesa e como ajustar ambas. Assim pode nascer outra ditadura! Os outros paises näo tem a mesma diversidade humana e cultural e näo tem a mesma quantidade de emigrantes espalhados pelo mundo. A RTP tem sido a unica estacäo a servir de facto as comunidades no estrangeiro (mesmo que com muitas falhas). Moro na Finlandia e tenho acesso á RTPi através da Internet. Só a RTP tem tido o dom de interagir com os emigrantes. O seu site näo é o que chamaria de ideal mas de longe o melhor, comparando com o da TVI e com o da SIC. A TVI informa sobre novelas e novelas pseudo reais. Que nojo! A SIC tem muito mais informacäo e dois canais visiveis na Net. Um idiota e o outro informativo...de Futebol!

""Isto"" da RTP não é uma questão moral, nem de impostos, nem de desperdício: é um roubo descarado do património de todos nós. Mas é também outra coisa: é a manifestação da vontade que este governo tem vindo a demonstrar de que, como não sabe governar, quer meter medo, quer impor as ideias causando medo na população. Aliás, o que eles têm dito sobre a situação do País mostra bem que lhes é necessário transformar uma crise orçamental, que é real, numa crise económica, que não existe na realidade mas que pode vir a fixar-se psicològicamente nos portugueses que, assim deprimidos e tristes, serão melhor e mais fàcilmente manobráveis. Eu sou uma mulher de fé e há muito boa gente neste nosso País que sabe pensar e é honesta. Uma dessas pessoas, para quem apelo com a força das cores da nossa Bandeira, é o Senhor Presidente da República que, estou certa, não deixará que uma tal vergonha aconteça. Será que ninguém vê que ""isto"" é o anúncio de um autentico ""golpe de estado""? A seguir o que virá?Até onde irão os golpistas se nós não nos levantarmos contra este desaforo?

Cultura Desporto Economia Media Local Lisboa Local Porto Última Página Ficha Técnica SÓ TEXTO   .   Sessão Pouco Produtiva Por PEDRO LIMA Quarta-feira, 9 de Agosto de 2000 O grupo PT voltou ontem a fazer sentir o seu elevado peso no mercado accionista português, levando mais uma vez os índices PSI-20 e BVL-30, que perderam 0,79 e 0,76 por cento, respectivamente, a fecharem em contraciclo com a generalidade dos mercados europeus. Os números da produtividade registada no segundo trimestre nos Estados Unidos surpreenderam os analistas, ao apresentarem um crescimento de 5,3 por cento, quando as previsões apontavam para 4,3 por cento. O aumento da produtividade é benéfico para os mercados, uma vez que implica que menos empregados estão a produzir mais, graças à automação de operações ou à informatização, por exemplo, reduzindo assim o risco de pressões inflacionistas por via do aumento da massa salarial. Aproveitando o clima favorável originado por estes números e ainda as subidas registadas nos últimos dias pela generalidade das acções, os investidores aproveitaram para fazer algumas mais-valias na ""nova economia"", levando o Nasdaq a fechar com menos 0,37 por cento, enquanto o Dow Jones subiu, no fecho, 1,01 por cento. Em Lisboa, a tendência negativa fez-se sentir em quase todas as empresas de maior capitalização bolsista, já que, dos 21 títulos que compõem o PSI-20 (tendo em conta as acções ""novas"" e ""velhas"" da Sonae SGPS), apenas quatro fecharam a subir. A PT continua a ser prejudicada pelo mal-estar causado pelo anúncio de um novo aumento de capital, que estará a apressar a saída de alguns fundos de investimento da empresa, uma tendência que afecta todo o sector na Europa. Ontem, a generalidade das operadoras de telecomunicações fixas fecharam com perdas, com excepção da Telefonica, que subiu 3,3 por cento. A PT viu a sua cotação perder mais 2,32 por cento, fechando nos 11,38 euros (2281 escudos), depois de ter descido aos 11,20 euros (2245 escudos). Quanto à PT Multimedia, terminou nos 44,01 euros (8823 escudos), com menos 1,43 por cento. A PTM.com também caiu, fechando nos 5,99 euros (1201 escudos), depois de ter sido negociada a 5,92 euros (1187 escudos), um novo mínimo histórico. A cotação de fecho de ontem representa, em relação a segunda-feira, uma desvalorização de 0,83 por cento. O Banco Santander Central Hispano (BSCH) viu, por seu lado, a sua cotação aumentar em 2,56 por cento, acompanhando a tendência registada em Madrid, graças àquilo que os operadores espanhóis dizem ser o regresso do interesse pelo sector financeiro. A Mota & Companhia registou uma das maiores subidas da sessão (3,02 por cento), encerrando a 12,98 euros (2602 escudos).

Após o fecho de negociação de ontem, a norte-americana Oracle apresentou resultados acima do esperado, criando a expectativa de alguma força para o sector tecnológico. No entanto, a Europa não reflectiu essa previsão, penalizada pelos fracos números macro-económicos. A produção industrial recuou em Outubro na Zona Euro, o instituto alemão de conjuntura IFO reviu em baixa a sua previsão de crescimento para Alemanha, de 0,5 para 0,2% em 2002, e a confiança dos consumidores italianos desceu para o mínimo dos últimos seis anos. Entre as principais bolsas internacionais, apenas Londres e Madrid encerraram em terreno positivo. O PSI 20 caiu 0,63%, para 5.898,73 pontos, pondo fim a uma série de três subidas consecutivas. Registaram-se apenas três subidas, 12 descidas e cinco títulos ficaram inalterados. O destaque do dia foi a EDP, que ganhou 3,11%, para 1,66 euros. Pela negativa, os destaques pertenceram aos dois maiores ""pesos-pesados"" do índice, a PT e o BCP. A maior perda pertenceu à Sonae SGPS, que caiu 2,38%, ou um cêntimo, para 0,41 euros.

Mas será que ainda há quem espere uma reforma fiscal?! Ussama Ben Laden: onde pára o dinheiro do alegado milionário? O homem mais procurado pelo FBI é constantemente crismado como milionário.

Percorreram tantos quilómetros como centenas de carros que, nos outros dias, se limitam a passar o dia de trabalho parados nos estacionamentos. O objectivo antipoluição da data esfumou-se. Cavaco Silva: mais um a pedir o descontrolo das despesas públicas O antigo primeiro-ministro juntou-se ao coro das vozes que apelam a que se meta na gaveta o objectivo de contenção do défice público, para que os Estados possam investir à grande e à francesa e, assim, dinamizarem a economia. Será que os economistas não têm mais imaginação para resolverem os problemas?!

33,0,12,0.797006155567991,0,7148,28,"A Coluna do Provedor do Leitor   . voltar ao índice O Que Parece e o Que É Por JOAQUIM FIDALGO Domingo, 28 de Janeiro de 2001 São os jornais como a mulher de César - a tal a quem convinha não só ser séria, mas também parecer? No que respeita a uma das mais decisivas ""pedras-de-toque"" de qualquer órgão de comunicação - a sua independência -, os leitores julgam frequentemente pelas aparências. Estão no seu direito, sobretudo quando conhecem menos bem os mecanismos do trabalho jornalístico. Ou quando há coincidências duvidosas. Mas, de facto, as coisas nem sempre são aquilo que parecem. Vamos a um exemplo. Continuam a chegar ao provedor queixas de leitores que não viram publicadas as suas ""Cartas ao Director"". Embora muitas vezes se trate de escritos perfeitamente consensuais e inofensivos, quase sempre os seus autores vislumbram motivos obscuros na decisão de não publicação. Numa palavra, censura. Ninguém quer admitir que a sua carta não foi publicada só porque era demasiado extensa, ou porque estava mal escrita, ou porque usava termos inaceitáveis, ou porque era desinteressante, ou porque se referia a assunto velho. Pensa-se que há sempre algo de deliberado ""contra"" o autor ou a sua opinião. Se parece censura, o facto é que não é. Garantiu-o já a Direcção do PÚBLICO, mais que uma vez, e pode confirmá-lo o provedor a partir da sua experiência. Haverá diversos motivos para a não publicação de cartas (uns mais objectivos que outros), mas entre eles não se conta o silenciamento por diferenças de opinião, desde que esta seja apresentada em modos correctos. O problema é que muitas cartas terão sempre de ficar de fora, dadas as limitações de espaço. É bom que ele aumente (o novo modelo gráfico parece permiti-lo, acrescentando mais um pedaço nos cadernos de informação local), mas, porventura, nunca será bastante. Resta ir afinando critérios e melhorando a sua compreensão. Vamos a outro exemplo. A partir de duas notícias desta semana, o leitor Rogério Santos pergunta se não se estará ""a usar o jornal para defender o interesse do empresário [Belmiro de Azevedo], que é também patrão do jornal"". Uma das notícias (22/1) reportava-se à ""análise"" dominical de Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa na TVI, referindo as suas críticas a Durão Barroso e a Santana Lopes. Nela nada se dizia sobre um outro tema abordado por Marcelo - o da recente posição do Tribunal de Contas a propósito do negócio da Torralta com o grupo Sonae. Segundo o leitor, este assunto ""teria mais noticiabilidade"", mas, aparentemente, ""não encaixa nos valores-notícia do PÚBLICO: o patrão do jornal era criticado"". Parece evidente que o assunto Torralta/Sonae teria ""noticiabilidade"" - mas desde que fosse novo. Ora, como recorda a jornalista Eunice Lourenço, a posição do Tribunal de Contas sobre o dito negócio tinha sido noticiada pelo PÚBLICO três dias antes, na secção de Economia, e com razoável desenvolvimento (texto sob o título ""Estado perdeu dinheiro no negócio com a Sonae, diz tribunal - Torralta, uma opção política""). Não era novo, portanto. ""A novidade era a resposta de Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa ao desafio lançado por Santana Lopes"", acrescenta Eunice Lourenço. Não se escondeu, portanto, uma informação porventura desagradável para Belmiro de Azevedo. A querer ignorar-se a posição do Tribunal de Contas, não se teria feito a notícia da Economia. Observaram-se, e bem, apenas critérios jornalísticos. A outra notícia que suscitou reservas ao leitor Rogério Santos saiu na edição de 21/1 e relatava passos da intervenção do patrão do PÚBLICO num colóquio promovido pelo Lions Clube em Lousada (""Belmiro diz que Portugal 'precisa de um Governo forte'""). Sublinhando o forte destaque do texto, o leitor chama a atenção para um ponto concreto: deu-se nota das críticas de Belmiro de Azevedo à reforma fiscal do actual Governo, mas nada se referiu ""sobre a transferência de participações da Sonae (...) para o estrangeiro, para evitar o novo quadro fiscal, considerado mais apertado quanto à tributação de mais-valias das 'holdings'"". Aqui, já o caso é menos óbvio. Desde logo, o leitor tem razão num ponto (como, de resto, concordam a autora do trabalho, Rita Siza, e o subdirector Manuel Carvalho, que o agendou e acompanhou): ao citar as críticas do líder da Sonae ao novo enquadramento fiscal, devia ter-se recordado a sua recente decisão de transferir para o estrangeiro a sede de uma sub-""holding"". É isso que manda o estilo do PÚBLICO: contextuar adequadamente a informação, não tanto para que não pareça parcial, mas, sobretudo, para que seja mais rigorosa, mais profunda, mais completa. Aliás, quanto a este assunto específico, diga-se que o jornal não o acompanhou, nas últimas semanas, com a atenção que ele mereceria. Pode não ter sido pelo facto de implicar a Sonae. Pode ter sido por caberem a outro jornal (o ""Diário Económico"") os méritos da ""cacha"". Pode ter sido por distracção ou má avaliação da sua relevância jornalística. Mas, aqui sim, o que ""parece"" - mesmo se não ""é"" - tem a sua importância... Não espanta que os leitores verifiquem a coincidência e conjecturem sobre ela. Já quanto à oportunidade jornalística de ir a Lousada fazer a cobertura de um colóquio promovido pelo Lions Clube (muitos congéneres se perguntarão que voltas hão-de dar para conseguir a atenção dos jornais...) e quanto à circunstância de o texto quase só falar de Belmiro de Azevedo, é terreno mais subjectivo. O subdirector Manuel Carvalho afirma sem pejo que a presença do empresário foi ""determinante"" para a decisão de o agendar - ""mas não pelo facto de ele ser o patrão do PÚBLICO, e sim por ser quem é, um empresário muito importante e uma figura fortemente mediática, até porque costuma apresentar as suas opiniões com grande desassombro e sem papas na língua"". Rita Siza ""puxou"", na notícia, pelo que lhe pareceu mais relevante (as críticas ao Governo e a postura positiva face ao alargamento europeu a Leste), e jornalisticamente justifica-se. A decisão de publicar ""teve a ver com isso e nada mais"", garante Manuel Carvalho, recordando que, não há muito tempo, se enviou uma jornalista a uma outra sessão pública, na qual participava Belmiro de Azevedo, e acabou por nada se escrever, por se ter entendido que nada de novo lá fora dito. Parece claro que Belmiro de Azevedo não deve ser favorecido pelo facto de ser o patrão do PÚBLICO. Mas também não deve ser penalizado por isso. Que é muitas vezes notícia, prova-o a atenção que lhe dispensa a generalidade da comunicação social. Em nome precisamente da independência, o PÚBLICO não deve ser excepção - nem tratá-lo de modo excepcional, seja por excesso ou por defeito. EM SÍNTESE Cartas Haverá diversos motivos para a não publicação de cartas dos leitores, mas entre eles não se conta a censura. Independência Um jornal não deve favorecer o seu dono só pelo facto de o ser, mas também não deve penalizá-lo por isso.

Sonae subiu 4 %, com preço de ""saldo"" e expectativas de resultados A Bolsa de Lisboa subiu ontem 2,34 %, uma das maiores subidas do ano. Depois de uma abertura em ligeira baixa, o mercado de acções seguiu a euforia das primeiras horas do Nasdaq, a bolsa electrónica de Nova Iorque (que acabou por fechar com perdas). Ao contrário das restantes bolsas do Velho Continente, em queda devido à pressão de operações para realização de mais-valias. Em alta esteve ontem a Sonae-SGPS (mais 4,0 %), que fechou nos 0,52 euros, no dia em que anunciou lucros de 18,5 milhões de euros. Também a EDP, depois da volatilidade do dia anterior, encerrou com ganhos (mais 3,97 %), nos 2,62 euros. A Portugal Telecom subiu, fixando-se nos 6,70 euros (mais 1,67 %). O BPI, na sua última nota de research , reiterou a sua recomendação de compra para a operadora telefónica, com um price target de 10,30 euros. A banca também esteve toda positiva, com destaque para o BES - mais 4,17 %, para 11,98 euros -, apesar do arrefecimento económico e a quebra no consumo poder trazer dificuldades às instituições financeiras. Por seu lado, a Caixa Valores reviu o preço-alvo para a Sonae-Indústria para 7,5 euros - a empresa fechou a 4,02 euros. Penalizada pelos resultados semestrais, a Impresa caiu 2,76 %, para 1,41 euros. E apesar da nova conjuntura benéfica para o preço da pasta, a Portucel desceu 1,14 %,para 0,87 euros. Os analistas falam agora em estratégias defensivas para a compra e venda de acções. Ontem, um analista citado pela Reuters dizia que só lá para meados de Outubro é que a ""poeira"" deverá assentar, permitindo uma clarificação do rumo do mercado.

41,0,8,0.8043667173582446,1,9206,49,"A Coluna do Provedor do Leitor   . voltar ao índice O Seu a Seu Dono Por JOAQUIM FIDALGO Domingo, 12 de Novembro de 2000 Estava o provedor a ultimar o seu texto da passada semana - no qual, recorde-se, era questionada a ""colagem"", por motivos mais empresariais que jornalísticos, de certos órgãos de comunicação social a certos candidatos às eleições do Benfica - quando lhe caiu no correio electrónico uma interrogação, digamos, picante. A maneira mais simples de a apresentar será transcrever, tal e qual, a dúvida do leitor Paulo Araújo: ""A primeira página do PÚBLICO de hoje [sexta-feira, 3/11/00] deixou-me perplexo. Ou melhor, angustiado. A manchete é a 'joint venture' entre Belmiro e Balsemão, e em letra pequenina o negócio de 53 milhões de contos PT/Lusomundo. Como a aliança Belmiro/Balsemão vale 400 mil contos, embora abra perspectivas maiores, e a compra da Lusomundo pela PT é, talvez, o maior negócio do ano em Portugal, lembrei-me de imediato das eleições do Benfica: TVI com Vilarinho, SIC com Vale e Azevedo. E aqui? PÚBLICO com Belmiro? Terá sido este o critério?"". Podia discorrer-se genericamente sobre o assunto (por vezes melindroso, mas sempre pertinente) da independência dos jornais face aos poderes, designadamente o poder económico - e, muito em particular, o poder patronal dentro de uma empresa de comunicação social. São as administrações que mandam no conteúdo dos jornais? Conseguem os responsáveis editoriais preservar a sua autonomia e manter a independência da publicação, mesmo face aos titulares do capital que assegura a sobrevivência económica da empresa? Os ""donos"" das empresas de media entendem esta necessidade de separação de poderes, em nome da credibilidade dos órgãos de comunicação junto da opinião pública, ou vão cedendo à tentação de os instrumentalizar em benefício de negócios próprios, de promoção, de imagem? E os jornalistas, eles mesmos, são capazes de tratar com distanciamento matérias porventura negativas para o seu patrão, ou, de modo mais ou menos consciente, sucumbem ao ""zelo"" de evitar esses caminhos, com receio de eventuais consequências?... São matérias importantes, e que a progressiva incorporação de empresas editoriais em grupos alheios a esse universo específico - algo que se passa em todo o mundo, Portugal incluído - torna ainda mais pertinentes.  Mas, por muito desafiador que seja o tema assim equacionado, o que parece lógico, aqui e agora, é que nos atenhamos ao caso concreto apresentado pelo leitor. Vamos aos factos - e concluamos o que eles nos permitirem concluir. Resumidamente, que questiona o leitor? Três pontos: a) se o PÚBLICO deu ou não o merecido destaque ao mega-negócio que permitiu à Portugal Telecom assumir o controlo integral do grupo Lusomundo; b) se o PÚBLICO, em contrapartida, hipervalorizou um negócio aparentemente menor, como foi o de uma ""joint venture"" específica entre os grupos de Pinto Balsemão e de Belmiro de Azevedo; c) se o PÚBLICO fez o que fez não tanto por critérios jornalísticos mas para pôr em relevo um negócio que envolve o seu patrão (o capital social do PÚBLICO é detido pelo grupo Sonae,a que preside Belmiro de Azevedo). Sobre o primeiro, convirá não esquecer que foi o PÚBLICO quem ""descobriu"" o negócio PT/Lusomundo e o noticiou em exclusivo, logo na quarta-feira, 1/11. A ""cacha"" foi considerada de tal modo importante que acabou por nem esperar para o dia seguinte, embora tenha sido publicada na última página, e em apenas parte do PÙBLICO (a edição Porto), pois, à hora tardia a que foi conhecida, já a edição Lisboa estava fechada e o jornal a imprimir. O PÚBLICO On-line também difundiu a novidade. Na quinta-feira, 2/11, foi o PÚBLICO quem voltou a puxar pelo assunto, agora já na totalidade da edição, ""fazendo uma chamada de primeira página e abrindo com este tema a sua secção de Economia"", como explica o director, José Manuel Fernandes. Nesse dia, a generalidade da imprensa diária (entre ela os próprios títulos do universo Lusomundo) nem se referiu ao negócio em perspectiva. Na sexta-feira, 3/11, quando foi oficialmente conhecido o desfecho da transacção, todos os jornais falaram dela com destaque e o PÚBLICO também: voltou a abrir a secção de Economia com essa matéria, tendo-lhe feito nova referência na capa. ""Mas não fez manchete..."", dir-se-á. Responde o director: ""Não era lógico, em termos jornalísticos, fazer manchete com um tema que o próprio PÚBLICO tinha noticiado em primeira mão e que desenvolvera nas vésperas. A notícia em si já não era nova, pois já a tínhamos dado no essencial, faltando apenas falar dos contornos finais e do valor envolvido. Fizemo-lo com um destaque que me parece adequado"". A questão da manchete de sexta-feira, 3/11 (""Belmiro e Balsemão consumam aliança"") remete-nos para o segundo ponto sugerido pelo leitor: o PÚBLICO hipervalorizou um negócio menor? José Manuel Fernandes sublinha, a este propósito, que ""para efeitos jornalísticos, os negócios nem sempre se medem só pelos milhares ou milhões de contos envolvidos"". A anunciada parceria entre Belmiro de Azevedo e Pinto Balsemão, além de ser para o PÚBLICO ""uma novidade absoluta desse dia"" (coisa que não sucedia com a venda da Lusomundo á PT), era uma notícia ""com um impacto que está muito para além dos 400 mil contos do negócio"", defende o director do PÚBLICO, justificando: ""Esta aproximação representa uma mudança de estratégia de dois grupos empresariais fundamentais em Portugal e poderá ter fortes repercussões no futuro. Foi por isso que a considerámos importante e a colocámos em manchete, e não por estarem envolvidos Belmiro de Azevedo e o grupo Sonae"". O que nos remete, então, para o terceiro ponto. A avaliação da importância relativa de uma notícia é subjectiva. Quase todos os dias, os principais jornais escolhem temas diferentes para as suas primeiras páginas, com os leitores a identificarem-se mais ora com estas, ora com aquelas. A escolha depende das particularidades do jornal, do modo como ele julga tocar melhor os seus leitores, da sensibilidade de quem conduz a edição, até da maior ou menor ""oferta"" de notícias no dia... Veja-se: na mesma sexta-feira em que o PÚBLICO entendeu puxar para manchete o negócio Belmiro/Balsemão (pelas razões atrás avançadas pelo seu director, e que podem não merecer a concordância de todos mas são, jornalisticamente, bastante defensáveis), o ""Diário de Notícias"" entendeu remeter o assunto para uma notícia de meia dúzia de linhas, numa página interior. Fê-lo por ser um jornal ligado ao grupo Lusomundo e por não querer dar importância a uma novidade que punha em realce a ""concorrência""? Haverá quem pense que sim, mas não é forçoso. Os seus responsáveis editoriais podem, muito legitimamente, ter decidido que a notícia daquela parceria entre os grupos Impresa e Sonae, formalmente consubstanciada apenas numa ""joint venture"" para iniciativas ""on-line"", não tinha relevância jornalística para mais do que uma referência breve. E foi o que fizeram. O facto de PÚBLICO e Diário de Notícias terem, a propósito de uma mesma notícia, feito uma avaliação substancialmente diferente da sua importância - e, em consequência, optado por lhe dar uma visibilidade diversa -, é algo que acontece com frequência. A circunstância de, neste episódio, estarem envolvidos os patrões das respectivas empresas não nos autoriza, por si só, a especular sobre as reais motivações dos responsáveis editoriais. Se há argumentos claramente jornalísticos justificando as opções tomadas, são esses que devemos discutir. Concordando mais ou concordando menos, claro. A diversidade é boa. Em conclusão, entende o provedor que o PÚBLICO não merece especiais críticas neste caso. Dificilmente pode ser acusado de ter dado pouca importância ao negócio PT/Lusomundo, quando foi ele próprio quem o descobriu e desenvolveu em edições sucessivas, mais do que qualquer outro jornal. Tão-pouco pode ser acusado de ter valorizado artificialmente um acordo empresarial entre Pinto Balsemão e Belmiro de Azevedo, quando é sabido que as relações entre os dois proeminentes empresários passaram por anos de grande frieza mas, nos últimos tempos, se vinham avolumando os rumores (enfim confirmados) de uma aproximação. E reduzir esta aproximação a um mero negócio de 400 mil contos talvez seja pouco perspicaz. Não se pretende, com isto, dizer que o PÚBLICO é uma publicação ""sem pecado"" no que respeita ao modo como noticia (ou não noticia...) as matérias envolvendo os negócios do seu patrão ou das empresas Sonae. Não se pretende afirmar que, nesta matéria, o PÚBLICO não tem ""telhados de vidro"". Nem que os tem. Sustenta-se apenas que, no caso concreto aqui apreciado, não parece ter havido distorção de critérios jornalísticos ou actuação dependente de lógicas empresariais estranhas à esfera editorial. Só isto. Havendo outros casos, apresentem-se e discutam-se. Ficar pelas suspeitas genéricas ou pelos processos de intenção, isso é que parece pouco útil.

Introduction This Referral presents substantial and credible information that President Clinton criminally obstructed the judicial process, first in a sexual harassment lawsuit in which he was the defendant and then in a grand jury investigation. The opening section of the Narrative provides an overview of the object of the President's cover-up, the sexual relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. Subsequent sections recount the evolution of the relationship chronologically, including the sexual contacts, the President's efforts to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena in Jones v. Clinton , the role of Vernon Jordan, the President's discussions with Ms. Lewinsky about her affidavit and deposition, the President's deposition testimony in Jones , the President's attempts to coach a potential witness in the harassment case, the President's false and misleading statements to aides and to the American public after the Lewinsky story became public, and, finally, the President's testimony before a federal grand jury. B. Evidence Establishing Nature of Relationship 1. Physical Evidence Physical evidence conclusively establishes that the President and Ms. Lewinsky had a sexual relationship. After reaching an immunity and cooperation agreement with the Office of the Independent Counsel on July 28, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky turned over a navy blue dress that she said she had worn during a sexual encounter with the President on February 28, 1997. According to Ms. Lewinsky, she noticed stains on the garment the next time she took it from her closet. From their location, she surmised that the stains were the President's semen. (1) Initial tests revealed that the stains are in fact semen. (2) Based on that result, the OIC asked the President for a blood sample. (3) After requesting and being given assurances that the OIC had an evidentiary basis for making the request, the President agreed. (4) In the White House Map Room on August 3, 1998, the White House Physician drew a vial of blood from the President in the presence of an FBI agent and an OIC attorney. (5) By conducting the two standard DNA comparison tests, the FBI Laboratory concluded that the President was the source of the DNA obtained from the dress. (6) According to the more sensitive RFLP test, the genetic markers on the semen, which match the President's DNA, are characteristic of one out of 7.87 trillion Caucasians. (7) In addition to the dress, Ms. Lewinsky provided what she said were answering machine tapes containing brief messages from the President, as well as several gifts that the President had given her. 2. Ms. Lewinsky's Statements Ms. Lewinsky was extensively debriefed about her relationship with the President. For the initial evaluation of her credibility, she submitted to a detailed ""proffer"" interview on July 27, 1998. (8) After entering into a cooperation agreement, she was questioned over the course of approximately 15 days. She also provided testimony under oath on three occasions: twice before the grand jury, and, because of the personal and sensitive nature of particular topics, once in a deposition. In addition, Ms. Lewinsky worked with prosecutors and investigators to create an 11-page chart that chronologically lists her contacts with President Clinton, including meetings, phone calls, gifts, and messages. (9) Ms. Lewinsky twice verified the accuracy of the chart under oath. (10) In the evaluation of experienced prosecutors and investigators, Ms. Lewinsky has provided truthful information. She has not falsely inculpated the President. Harming him, she has testified, is ""the last thing in the world I want to do."" (11) Moreover, the OIC's immunity and cooperation agreement with Ms. Lewinsky includes safeguards crafted to ensure that she tells the truth. Court-ordered immunity and written immunity agreements often provide that the witness can be prosecuted only for false statements made during the period of cooperation, and not for the underlying offense. The OIC's agreement goes further, providing that Ms. Lewinsky will lose her immunity altogether if the government can prove to a federal district judge -- by a preponderance of the evidence, not the higher standard of beyond a reasonable doubt -- that she lied. Moreover, the agreement provides that, in the course of such a prosecution, the United States could introduce into evidence the statements made by Ms. Lewinsky during her cooperation. Since Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged in her proffer interview and in debriefings that she violated the law, she has a strong incentive to tell the truth: If she did not, it would be relatively straightforward to void the immunity agreement and prosecute her, using her own admissions against her. 3. Ms. Lewinsky's Confidants Between 1995 and 1998, Ms. Lewinsky confided in 11 people about her relationship with the President. All have been questioned by the OIC, most before a federal grand jury: Andrew Bleiler, Catherine Allday Davis, Neysa Erbland, Kathleen Estep, Deborah Finerman, Dr. Irene Kassorla, Marcia Lewis, Ashley Raines, Linda Tripp, Natalie Ungvari, and Dale Young. (12) Ms. Lewinsky told most of these confidants about events in her relationship with the President as they occurred, sometimes in considerable detail. Some of Ms. Lewinsky's statements about the relationship were contemporaneously memorialized. These include deleted email recovered from her home computer and her Pentagon computer, email messages retained by two of the recipients, tape recordings of some of Ms. Lewinsky's conversations with Ms. Tripp, and notes taken by Ms. Tripp during some of their conversations. The Tripp notes, which have been extensively corroborated, refer specifically to places, dates, and times of physical contacts between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. (13) Everyone in whom Ms. Lewinsky confided in detail believed she was telling the truth about her relationship with the President. Ms. Lewinsky told her psychologist, Dr. Irene Kassorla, about the affair shortly after it began. Thereafter, she related details of sexual encounters soon after they occurred (sometimes calling from her White House office). (14) Ms. Lewinsky showed no indications of delusional thinking, according to Dr. Kassorla, and Dr. Kassorla had no doubts whatsoever about the truth of what Ms. Lewinsky told her. (15) Ms. Lewinsky's friend Catherine Allday Davis testified that she believed Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of the sexual relationship with the President because ""I trusted in the way she had confided in me on other things in her life. . . . I just trusted the relationship, so I trusted her."" (16) Dale Young, a friend in whom Ms. Lewinsky confided starting in mid-1996, testified: [I]f she was going to lie to me, she would have said to me, ""Oh, he calls me all the time. He does wonderful things. He can't wait to see me."" . . . [S]he would have embellished the story. You know, she wouldn't be telling me, ""He told me he'd call me, I waited home all weekend and I didn't do anything and he didn't call and then he didn't call for two weeks."" (17) 4. Documents In addition to her remarks and email to friends, Ms. Lewinsky wrote a number of documents, including letters and draft letters to the President. Among these documents are (i) papers found in a consensual search of her apartment; (ii) papers that Ms. Lewinsky turned over pursuant to her cooperation agreement, including a calendar with dates circled when she met or talked by telephone with the President in 1996 and 1997; and (iii) files recovered from Ms. Lewinsky's computers at home and at the Pentagon. 5. Consistency and Corroboration The details of Ms. Lewinsky's many statements have been checked, cross-checked, and corroborated. When negotiations with Ms. Lewinsky in January and February 1998 did not culminate in an agreement, the OIC proceeded with a comprehensive investigation, which generated a great deal of probative evidence. In July and August 1998, circumstances brought more direct and compelling evidence to the investigation. After the courts rejected a novel privilege claim, Secret Service officers and agents testified about their observations of the President and Ms. Lewinsky in the White House. Ms. Lewinsky agreed to submit to a proffer interview (previous negotiations had deadlocked over her refusal to do so), and, after assessing her credibility in that session, the OIC entered into a cooperation agreement with her. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Ms. Lewinsky turned over the dress that proved to bear traces of the President's semen. And the President, who had spurned six invitations to testify, finally agreed to provide his account to the grand jury. In that sworn testimony, he acknowledged ""inappropriate intimate contact"" with Ms. Lewinsky. Because of the fashion in which the investigation had unfolded, in sum, a massive quantity of evidence was available to test and verify Ms. Lewinsky's statements during her proffer interview and her later cooperation. Consequently, Ms. Lewinsky's statements have been corroborated to a remarkable degree. Her detailed statements to the grand jury and the OIC in 1998 are consistent with statements to her confidants dating back to 1995, documents that she created, and physical evidence. (18) Moreover, her accounts generally match the testimony of White House staff members; the testimony of Secret Service agents and officers; and White House records showing Ms. Lewinsky's entries and exits, the President's whereabouts, and the President's telephone calls. C. Sexual Contacts 1. The President's Accounts a. Jones Testimony In the Jones deposition on January 17, 1998, the President denied having had ""a sexual affair,"" ""sexual relations,"" or ""a sexual relationship"" with Ms. Lewinsky. (19) He noted that ""[t]here are no curtains on the Oval Office, there are no curtains on my private office, there are no curtains or blinds that can close [on] the windows in my private dining room,"" and added: ""I have done everything I could to avoid the kind of questions you are asking me here today. . . ."" (20) During the deposition, the President's attorney, Robert Bennett, sought to limit questioning about Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Bennett told Judge Susan Webber Wright that Ms. Lewinsky had executed ""an affidavit which [Ms. Jones's lawyers] are in possession of saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, with President Clinton."" In a subsequent colloquy with Judge Wright, Mr. Bennett declared that as a result of ""preparation of [President Clinton] for this deposition, the witness is fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit."" (21) The President did not dispute his legal representative's assertion that the President and Ms. Lewinsky had had ""absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form,"" nor did he dispute the implication that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, in denying ""a sexual relationship,"" meant that there was ""absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form."" In subsequent questioning by his attorney, President Clinton testified under oath that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit was ""absolutely true."" (22) b. Grand Jury Testimony Testifying before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, seven months after his Jones deposition, the President acknowledged ""inappropriate intimate contact"" with Ms. Lewinsky but maintained that his January deposition testimony was accurate. (23) In his account, ""what began as a friendship [with Ms. Lewinsky] came to include this conduct."" (24) He said he remembered ""meeting her, or having my first real conversation with her during the government shutdown in November of '95."" According to the President, the inappropriate contact occurred later (after Ms. Lewinsky's internship had ended), ""in early 1996 and once in early 1997."" (25) The President refused to answer questions about the precise nature of his intimate contacts with Ms. Lewinsky, but he did explain his earlier denials. (26) As to his denial in the Jones deposition that he and Ms. Lewinsky had had a ""sexual relationship,"" the President maintained that there can be no sexual relationship without sexual intercourse, regardless of what other sexual activities may transpire. He stated that ""most ordinary Americans"" would embrace this distinction. (27) The President also maintained that none of his sexual contacts with Ms. Lewinsky constituted ""sexual relations"" within a specific definition used in the Jones deposition. (28) Under that definition: [A] person engages in ""sexual relations"" when the person knowingly engages in or causes -- (1) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person . . . . ""Contact"" means intentional touching, either directly or through clothing. (29) According to what the President testified was his understanding, this definition ""covers contact by the person being deposed with the enumerated areas, if the contact is done with an intent to arouse or gratify,"" but it does not cover oral sex performed on the person being deposed. (30) He testified: [I]f the deponent is the person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is with -- not with anything on that list, but with the lips of another person. It seems to be self-evident that that's what it is. . . . Let me remind you, sir, I read this carefully. (31) In the President's view, ""any person, reasonable person"" would recognize that oral sex performed on the deponent falls outside the definition. (32) If Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on the President, then -- under this interpretation -- she engaged in sexual relations but he did not. The President refused to answer whether Ms. Lewinsky in fact had performed oral sex on him. (33) He did testify that direct contact with Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia would fall within the definition, and he denied having had any such contact. (34) 2. Ms. Lewinsky's Account In his grand jury testimony, the President relied heavily on a particular interpretation of ""sexual relations"" as defined in the Jones deposition. Beyond insisting that his conduct did not fall within the Jones definition, he refused to answer questions about the nature of his physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, thus placing the grand jury in the position of having to accept his conclusion without being able to explore the underlying facts. This strategy -- evidently an effort to account for possible traces of the President's semen on Ms. Lewinsky's clothing without undermining his position that he did not lie in the Jones deposition -- mandates that this Referral set forth evidence of an explicit nature that otherwise would be omitted. In light of the President's testimony, Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of their sexual encounters are indispensable for two reasons. First, the detail and consistency of these accounts tend to bolster Ms. Lewinsky's credibility. Second, and particularly important, Ms. Lewinsky contradicts the President on a key issue. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President touched her breasts and genitalia -- which means that his conduct met the Jones definition of sexual relations even under his theory. On these matters, the evidence of the President's perjury cannot be presented without specific, explicit, and possibly offensive descriptions of sexual encounters. According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had ten sexual encounters, eight while she worked at the White House and two thereafter. (35) The sexual encounters generally occurred in or near the private study off the Oval Office -- most often in the windowless hallway outside the study. (36) During many of their sexual encounters, the President stood leaning against the doorway of the bathroom across from the study, which, he told Ms. Lewinsky, eased his sore back. (37) Ms. Lewinsky testified that her physical relationship with the President included oral sex but not sexual intercourse. (38) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the President; he never performed oral sex on her. (39) Initially, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President would not let her perform oral sex to completion. In Ms. Lewinsky's understanding, his refusal was related to ""trust and not knowing me well enough."" (40) During their last two sexual encounters, both in 1997, he did ejaculate. (41) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the President on nine occasions. On all nine of those occasions, the President fondled and kissed her bare breasts. He touched her genitals, both through her underwear and directly, bringing her to orgasm on two occasions. On one occasion, the President inserted a cigar into her vagina. On another occasion, she and the President had brief genital-to-genital contact. (42) Whereas the President testified that ""what began as a friendship came to include [intimate contact],"" Ms. Lewinsky explained that the relationship moved in the opposite direction: ""[T]he emotional and friendship aspects . . . developed after the beginning of our sexual relationship."" (43) D. Emotional Attachment As the relationship developed over time, Ms. Lewinsky grew emotionally attached to President Clinton. She testified: ""I never expected to fall in love with the President. I was surprised that I did."" (44) Ms. Lewinsky told him of her feelings. (45) At times, she believed that he loved her too. (46) They were physically affectionate: ""A lot of hugging, holding hands sometimes. He always used to push the hair out of my face."" (47) She called him ""Handsome""; on occasion, he called her ""Sweetie,"" ""Baby,"" or sometimes ""Dear."" (48) He told her that he enjoyed talking to her -- she recalled his saying that the two of them were ""emotive and full of fire,"" and she made him feel young. (50) He said he wished he could spend more time with her. (51) Ms. Lewinsky told confidants of the emotional underpinnings of the relationship as it evolved. According to her mother, Marcia Lewis, the President once told Ms. Lewinsky that she ""had been hurt a lot or something by different men and that he would be her friend or he would help her, not hurt her."" (52) According to Ms. Lewinsky's friend Neysa Erbland, President Clinton once confided in Ms. Lewinsky that he was uncertain whether he would remain married after he left the White House. He said in essence, ""[W]ho knows what will happen four years from now when I am out of office?"" Ms. Lewinsky thought, according to Ms. Erbland, that ""maybe she will be his wife."" (53) E. Conversations and Phone Messages Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President ""enjoyed talking to each other and being with each other."" In her recollection, ""We would tell jokes. We would talk about our childhoods. Talk about current events. I was always giving him my stupid ideas about what I thought should be done in the administration or different views on things."" (54) One of Ms. Lewinsky's friends testified that, in her understanding, ""[The President] would talk about his childhood and growing up, and [Ms. Lewinsky] would relay stories about her childhood and growing up. I guess normal conversations that you would have with someone that you're getting to know."" (55) The longer conversations often occurred after their sexual contact. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""[W]hen I was working there [at the White House] . . . we'd start in the back [in or near the private study] and we'd talk and that was where we were physically intimate, and we'd usually end up, kind of the pillow talk of it, I guess, . . . sitting in the Oval Office . . . ."" (56) During several meetings when they were not sexually intimate, they talked in the Oval Office or in the area of the study. (57) Along with face-to-face meetings, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she spoke on the telephone with the President approximately 50 times, often after 10 p.m. and sometimes well after midnight. (58) The President placed the calls himself or, during working hours, had his secretary, Betty Currie, do so; Ms. Lewinsky could not telephone him directly, though she sometimes reached him through Ms. Currie. (59) Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""[W]e spent hours on the phone talking."" (60) Their telephone conversations were ""[s]imilar to what we discussed in person, just how we were doing. A lot of discussions about my job, when I was trying to come back to the White House and then once I decided to move to New York. . . . We talked about everything under the sun."" (61) On 10 to 15 occasions, she and the President had phone sex. (62) After phone sex late one night, the President fell asleep mid-conversation. (63) On four occasions, the President left very brief messages on Ms. Lewinsky's answering machine, though he told her that he did not like doing so because (in her recollection) he ""felt it was a little unsafe."" (64) She saved his messages and played the tapes for several confidants, who said they believed that the voice was the President's. (65) By phone and in person, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President sometimes had arguments. On a number of occasions in 1997, she complained that he had not brought her back from the Pentagon to work in the White House, as he had promised to do after the election. (66) In a face-to-face meeting on July 4, 1997, the President reprimanded her for a letter she had sent him that obliquely threatened to disclose their relationship. (67) During an argument on December 6, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said that ""he had never been treated as poorly by anyone else as I treated him,"" and added that ""he spent more time with me than anyone else in the world, aside from his family, friends and staff, which I don't know exactly which category that put me in."" (68) Testifying before the grand jury, the President confirmed that he and Ms. Lewinsky had had personal conversations, and he acknowledged that their telephone conversations sometimes included ""inappropriate sexual banter."" (69) The President said that Ms. Lewinsky told him about ""her personal life,"" ""her upbringing,"" and ""her job ambitions."" (70) After terminating their intimate relationship in 1997, he said, he tried ""to be a friend to Ms. Lewinsky, to be a counselor to her, to give her good advice, and to help her."" (71) F. Gifts Ms. Lewinsky and the President exchanged numerous gifts. By her estimate, she gave him about 30 items, and he gave her about 18. (72) Ms. Lewinsky's first gift to him was a matted poem given by her and other White House interns to commemorate ""National Boss Day,"" October 24, 1995. (73) This was the only item reflected in White House records that Ms. Lewinsky gave the President before (in her account) the sexual relationship began, and the only item that he sent to the archives instead of keeping. (74) On November 20 -- five days after the intimate relationship began, according to Ms. Lewinsky -- she gave him a necktie, which he chose to keep rather than send to the archives. (75) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned the night she gave him the tie, then sent her a photo of himself wearing it. (76) The tie was logged pursuant to White House procedures for gifts to the President. (77) In a draft note to the President in December 1997, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that she was ""very particular about presents and could never give them to anyone else -- they were all bought with you in mind."" (78) Many of the 30 or so gifts that she gave the President reflected his interests in history, antiques, cigars, and frogs. Ms. Lewinsky gave him, among other things, six neckties, an antique paperweight showing the White House, a silver tabletop holder for cigars or cigarettes, a pair of sunglasses, a casual shirt, a mug emblazoned ""Santa Monica,"" a frog figurine, a letter opener depicting a frog, several novels, a humorous book of quotations, and several antique books. (79) He gave her, among other things, a hat pin, two brooches, a blanket, a marble bear figurine, and a special edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass . (80) Ms. Lewinsky construed it as a sign of affection when the President wore a necktie or other item of clothing she had given him. She testified: ""I used to say to him that 'I like it when you wear my ties because then I know I'm close to your heart.' So -- literally and figuratively."" (81) The President was aware of her reaction, according to Ms. Lewinsky, and he would sometimes wear one of the items to reassure her -- occasionally on the day they were scheduled to meet or the day after they had met in person or talked by telephone. (82) The President would sometimes say to her, ""Did you see I wore your tie the other day?"" (83) In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that he had exchanged a number of gifts with Ms. Lewinsky. After their intimate relationship ended in 1997, he testified, ""[S]he continued to give me gifts. And I felt that it was a right thing to do to give her gifts back."" (84) G. Messages According to Ms. Lewinsky, she sent the President a number of cards and letters. In some, she expressed anger that he was ""not paying enough attention to me""; in others, she said she missed him; in still others, she just sent ""a funny card that I saw."" (85) In early January 1998, she sent him, along with an antique book about American presidents, ""[a]n embarrassing mushy note."" (86) She testified that the President never sent her any cards or notes other than formal thank-you letters. (87) Testifying before the grand jury, the President acknowledged having received cards and notes from Ms. Lewinsky that were ""somewhat intimate"" and ""quite affectionate,"" even after the intimate relationship ended. (88) H. Secrecy 1. Mutual Understanding Both Ms. Lewinsky and the President testified that they took steps to maintain the secrecy of the relationship. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President from the outset stressed the importance of keeping the relationship secret. In her handwritten statement to this Office, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that ""the President told Ms. L to deny a relationship, if ever asked about it. He also said something to the effect of if the two people who are involved say it didn't happen -- it didn't happen."" (89) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President sometimes asked if she had told anyone about their sexual relationship or about the gifts they had exchanged; she (falsely) assured him that she had not. (90) She told him that ""I would always deny it, I would always protect him,"" and he responded approvingly. (91) The two of them had, in her words, ""a mutual understanding"" that they would ""keep this private, so that meant deny it and . . . take whatever appropriate steps needed to be taken."" (92) When she and the President both were subpoenaed to testify in the Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky anticipated that ""as we had on every other occasion and every other instance of this relationship, we would deny it."" (93) In his grand jury testimony, the President confirmed his efforts to keep their liaisons secret. (94) He said he did not want the facts of their relationship to be disclosed ""in any context,"" and added: ""I certainly didn't want this to come out, if I could help it. And I was concerned about that. I was embarrassed about it. I knew it was wrong."" (95) Asked if he wanted to avoid having the facts come out through Ms. Lewinsky's testimony in Jones , he said: ""Well, I did not want her to have to testify and go through that. And, of course, I didn't want her to do that, of course not."" (96) 2. Cover Stories For her visits to see the President, according to Ms. Lewinsky, ""[T]here was always some sort of a cover."" (97) When visiting the President while she worked at the White House, she generally planned to tell anyone who asked (including Secret Service officers and agents) that she was delivering papers to the President. (98) Ms. Lewinsky explained that this artifice may have originated when ""I got there kind of saying, 'Oh, gee, here are your letters,' wink, wink, wink, and him saying, 'Okay, that's good.'"" (99) To back up her stories, she generally carried a folder on these visits. (100) (In truth, according to Ms. Lewinsky, her job never required her to deliver papers to the President. (101) ) On a few occasions during her White House employment, Ms. Lewinsky and the President arranged to bump into each other in the hallway; he then would invite her to accompany him to the Oval Office. (102) Later, after she left the White House and started working at the Pentagon, Ms. Lewinsky relied on Ms. Currie to arrange times when she could see the President. The cover story for those visits was that Ms. Lewinsky was coming to see Ms. Currie, not the President. (103) While the President did not expressly instruct her to lie, according to Ms. Lewinsky, he did suggest misleading cover stories. (104) And, when she assured him that she planned to lie about the relationship, he responded approvingly. On the frequent occasions when Ms. Lewinsky promised that she would ""always deny"" the relationship and ""always protect him,"" for example, the President responded, in her recollection, ""'That's good,' or -- something affirmative. . . . [N]ot -- 'Don't deny it.'"" (105) Once she was named as a possible witness in the Jones case, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President reminded her of the cover stories. After telling her that she was a potential witness, the President suggested that, if she were subpoenaed, she could file an affidavit to avoid being deposed. He also told her she could say that, when working at the White House, she had sometimes delivered letters to him, and, after leaving her White House job, she had sometimes returned to visit Ms. Currie. (106) (The President's own testimony in the Jones case mirrors the recommendations he made to Ms. Lewinsky for her testimony. In his deposition, the President testified that he saw Ms. Lewinsky ""on two or three occasions"" during the November 1995 government furlough, ""one or two other times when she brought some documents to me,"" and ""sometime before Christmas"" when Ms. Lewinsky ""came by to see Betty."" (107) ) In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that he and Ms. Lewinsky ""might have talked about what to do in a nonlegal context"" to hide their relationship, and that he ""might well have said"" that Ms. Lewinsky should tell people that she was bringing letters to him or coming to visit Ms. Currie. (108) But he also stated that ""I never asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie."" (109) 3. Steps to Avoid Being Seen or Heard After their first two sexual encounters during the November 1995 government shutdown, according to Ms. Lewinsky, her encounters with the President generally occurred on weekends, when fewer people were in the West Wing. (110) Ms. Lewinsky testified: He had told me . . . that he was usually around on the weekends and that it was okay to come see him on the weekends. So he would call and we would arrange either to bump into each other in the hall or that I would bring papers to the office. (111) From some of the President's comments, Ms. Lewinsky gathered that she should try to avoid being seen by several White House employees, including Nancy Hernreich, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Oval Office Operations, and Stephen Goodin, the President's personal aide. (112) Out of concern about being seen, the sexual encounters most often occurred in the windowless hallway outside the study. (113) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was concerned that the two of them might be spotted through a White House window. When they were in the study together in the evenings, he sometimes turned out the light. (114) Once, when she spotted a gardener outside the study window, they left the room. (115) Ms. Lewinsky testified that, on December 28, 1997, ""when I was getting my Christmas kiss"" in the doorway to the study, the President was ""looking out the window with his eyes wide open while he was kissing me and then I got mad because it wasn't very romantic."" He responded, ""Well, I was just looking to see to make sure no one was out there."" (116) Fear of discovery constrained their sexual encounters in several respects, according to Ms. Lewinsky. The President ordinarily kept the door between the private hallway and the Oval Office several inches ajar during their encounters, both so that he could hear if anyone approached and so that anyone who did approach would be less likely to suspect impropriety. (117) During their sexual encounters, Ms. Lewinsky testified, ""[W]e were both aware of the volume and sometimes . . . I bit my hand -- so that I wouldn't make any noise."" (118) On one occasion, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President put his hand over her mouth during a sexual encounter to keep her quiet. (119) Concerned that they might be interrupted abruptly, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the two of them never fully undressed. (120) While noting that ""the door to the hallway was always somewhat open,"" the President testified that he did try to keep the intimate relationship secret: ""I did what people do when they do the wrong thing. I tried to do it where nobody else was looking at it."" (121) 4. Ms. Lewinsky's Notes and Letters The President expressed concern about documents that might hint at an improper relationship between them, according to Ms. Lewinsky. He cautioned her about messages she sent: There were . . . some occasions when I sent him cards or notes that I wrote things that he deemed too personal to put on paper just in case something ever happened, if it got lost getting there or someone else opened it. So there were several times when he remarked to me, you know, you shouldn't put that on paper. (122) She said that the President made this point to her in their last conversation, on January 5, 1998, in reference to what she characterized as ""[a]n embarrassing mushy note"" she had sent him. (123) In addition, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President expressed concerns about official records that could establish aspects of their relationship. She said that on two occasions she asked the President if she could go upstairs to the Residence with him. No, he said, because a record is kept of everyone who accompanies him there. (124) The President testified before the grand jury: ""I remember telling her she should be careful what she wrote, because a lot of it was clearly inappropriate and would be embarrassing if somebody else read it."" (125) 5. Ms. Lewinsky's Evaluation of Their Secrecy Efforts In two conversations recorded after she was subpoenaed in the Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky expressed confidence that her relationship with the President would never be discovered. (126) She believed that no records showed her and the President alone in the area of the study. (127) Regardless of the evidence, in any event, she would continue denying the relationship. ""If someone looked in the study window, it's not me,"" she said. (128) If someone produced tapes of her telephone calls with the President, she would say they were fakes. (129) In another recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky said she was especially comforted by the fact that the President, like her, would be swearing under oath that ""nothing happened."" (130) She said: [T]o tell you the truth, I'm not concerned all that much anymore because I know I'm not going to get in trouble. I will not get in trouble because you know what? The story I've signed under -- under oath is what someone else is saying under oath. (131) II. 1995: Initial Sexual Encounters Monica Lewinsky began her White House employment as an intern in the Chief of Staff's office in July 1995. At White House functions in the following months, she made eye contact with the President. During the November 1995 government shutdown, the President invited her to his private study, where they kissed. Later that evening, they had a more intimate sexual encounter. They had another sexual encounter two days later, and a third one on New Year's Eve. A. Overview of Monica Lewinsky's White House Employment Monica Lewinsky worked at the White House, first as an intern and then as an employee, from July 1995 to April 1996. With the assistance of family friend Walter Kaye, a prominent contributor to political causes, she obtained an internship starting in early July, when she was 21 years old. (132) She was assigned to work on correspondence in the office of Chief of Staff Leon Panetta in the Old Executive Office Building. (133) As her internship was winding down, Ms. Lewinsky applied for a paying job on the White House staff. She interviewed with Timothy Keating, Special Assistant to the President and Staff Director for Legislative Affairs. (134) Ms. Lewinsky accepted a position dealing with correspondence in the Office of Legislative Affairs on November 13, 1995, but did not start the job (and, thus, continued her internship) until November 26. (135) She remained a White House employee until April 1996, when -- in her view, because of her intimate relationship with the President -- she was dismissed from the White House and transferred to the Pentagon. (136) B. First Meetings with the President The month after her White House internship began, Ms. Lewinsky and the President began what she characterized as ""intense flirting."" (137) At departure ceremonies and other events, she made eye contact with him, shook hands, and introduced herself. (138) When she ran into the President in the West Wing basement and introduced herself again, according to Ms. Lewinsky, he responded that he already knew who she was. (139) Ms. Lewinsky told her aunt that the President ""seemed attracted to her or interested in her or something,"" and told a visiting friend that ""she was attracted to [President Clinton], she had a big crush on him, and I think she told me she at some point had gotten his attention, that there was some mutual eye contact and recognition, mutual acknowledgment."" (140) In the autumn of 1995, an impasse over the budget forced the federal government to shut down for one week, from Tuesday, November 14, to Monday, November 20. (141) Only essential federal employees were permitted to work during the furlough, and the White House staff of 430 shrank to about 90 people for the week. White House interns could continue working because of their unpaid status, and they took on a wide range of additional duties. (142) During the shutdown, Ms. Lewinsky worked in Chief of Staff Panetta's West Wing office, where she answered phones and ran errands. (143) The President came to Mr. Panetta's office frequently because of the shutdown, and he sometimes talked with Ms. Lewinsky. (144) She characterized these encounters as ""continued flirtation."" (145) According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff, Barry Toiv, remarked to her that she was getting a great deal of ""face time"" with the President. (146) C. November 15 Sexual Encounter Ms. Lewinsky testified that Wednesday, November 15, 1995 -- the second day of the government shutdown -- marked the beginning of her sexual relationship with the President. (147) On that date, she entered the White House at 1:30 p.m., left sometime thereafter (White House records do not show the time), reentered at 5:07 p.m., and departed at 12:18 a.m. on November 16. (148) The President was in the Oval Office or the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. Lewinsky worked during the furlough) for almost the identical period that Ms. Lewinsky was in the White House that evening, from 5:01 p.m. on November 15 to 12:35 a.m. on November 16. (149) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President made eye contact when he came to the West Wing to see Mr. Panetta and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, then again later at an informal birthday party for Jennifer Palmieri, Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff. (150) At one point, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked alone in the Chief of Staff's office. In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her pants. (151) En route to the restroom at about 8 p.m., she passed George Stephanopoulos's office. The President was inside alone, and he beckoned her to enter. (152) She told him that she had a crush on him. He laughed, then asked if she would like to see his private office. (153) Through a connecting door in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office, they went through the President's private dining room toward the study off the Oval Office. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""We talked briefly and sort of acknowledged that there had been a chemistry that was there before and that we were both attracted to each other and then he asked me if he could kiss me."" Ms. Lewinsky said yes. In the windowless hallway adjacent to the study, they kissed. (154) Before returning to her desk, Ms. Lewinsky wrote down her name and telephone number for the President. (155) At about 10 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she was alone in the Chief of Staff's office and the President approached. (156) He invited her to rendezvous again in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office in a few minutes, and she agreed. (157) (Asked if she knew why the President wanted to meet with her, Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""I had an idea."" (158) ) They met in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office and went again to the area of the private study. (159) This time the lights in the study were off. (160) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President kissed. She unbuttoned her jacket; either she unhooked her bra or he lifted her bra up; and he touched her breasts with his hands and mouth. (161) Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""I believe he took a phone call . . . and so we moved from the hallway into the back office . . . . [H]e put his hand down my pants and stimulated me manually in the genital area."" (162) While the President continued talking on the phone (Ms. Lewinsky understood that the caller was a Member of Congress or a Senator), she performed oral sex on him. (163) He finished his call, and, a moment later, told Ms. Lewinsky to stop. In her recollection: ""I told him that I wanted . . . to complete that. And he said . . . that he needed to wait until he trusted me more. And then I think he made a joke . . . that he hadn't had that in a long time."" (164) Both before and after their sexual contact during that encounter, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked. (165) At one point during the conversation, the President tugged on the pink intern pass hanging from her neck and said that it might be a problem. Ms. Lewinsky thought that he was talking about access -- interns were not supposed to be in the West Wing without an escort -- and, in addition, that he might have discerned some ""impropriety"" in a sexual relationship with a White House intern. (166) White House records corroborate details of Ms. Lewinsky's account. She testified that her November 15 encounters with the President occurred at about 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., and that in each case the two of them went from the Chief of Staff's office to the Oval Office area. (167) Records show that the President visited the Chief of Staff's office for one minute at 8:12 p.m. and for two minutes at 9:23 p.m., in each case returning to the Oval Office. (168) She recalled that the President took a telephone call during their sexual encounter, and she believed that the caller was a Member of Congress or a Senator. (169) White House records show that after returning to the Oval Office from the Chief of Staff's office, the President talked to two Members of Congress: Rep. Jim Chapman from 9:25 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., and Rep. John Tanner from 9:31 p.m. to 9:35 p.m. (170) D. November 17 Sexual Encounter According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had a second sexual encounter two days later (still during the government furlough), on Friday, November 17. She was at the White House until 8:56 p.m., then returned from 9:38 to 10:39 p.m. (171) At 9:45 p.m., a few minutes after Ms. Lewinsky's reentry, the President went from the Oval Office to the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. Lewinsky worked during the furlough) for one minute, then returned to the Oval Office for 30 minutes. From there, he went back to the Chief of Staff's office until 10:34 p.m. (approximately when Ms. Lewinsky left the White House), then went by the Oval Office and the Ground Floor before retiring to the Residence at 10:40 p.m. (172) Ms. Lewinsky testified: We were again working late because it was during the furlough and Jennifer Palmieri . . . had ordered pizza along with Ms. Currie and Ms. Hernreich. And when the pizza came, I went down to let them know that the pizza was there and it was at that point when I walked into Ms. Currie's office that the President was standing there with some other people discussing something. And they all came back to the office and Mr. -- I think it was Mr. Toiv, somebody accidentally knocked pizza on my jacket, so I went to go use the restroom to wash it off and as I was coming out of the restroom, the President was standing in Ms. Currie's doorway and said, ""You can come out this way."" (173) Ms. Lewinsky and the President went into the area of the private study, according to Ms. Lewinsky. There, either in the hallway or the bathroom, she and the President kissed. After a few minutes, in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she told him that she needed to get back to her desk. The President suggested that she bring him some slices of pizza. (174) A few minutes later, she returned to the Oval Office area with pizza and told Ms. Currie that the President had requested it. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""[Ms. Currie] opened the door and said, 'Sir, the girl's here with the pizza.' He told me to come in. Ms. Currie went back into her office and then we went into the back study area again."" (175) Several witnesses confirm that when Ms. Lewinsky delivered pizza to the President that night, the two of them were briefly alone. (176) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President had a sexual encounter during this visit. (177) They kissed, and the President touched Ms. Lewinsky's bare breasts with his hands and mouth. (178) At some point, Ms. Currie approached the door leading to the hallway, which was ajar, and said that the President had a telephone call. (179) Ms. Lewinsky recalled that the caller was a Member of Congress with a nickname. (180) While the President was on the telephone, according to Ms. Lewinsky, ""he unzipped his pants and exposed himself,"" and she performed oral sex. (181) Again, he stopped her before he ejaculated. (182) During this visit, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her that he liked her smile and her energy. He also said: ""I'm usually around on weekends, no one else is around, and you can come and see me."" (183) Records corroborate Ms. Lewinsky's recollection that the President took a call from a Member of Congress with a nickname. While Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House that evening (9:38 to 10:39 p.m.), the President had one telephone conversation with a Member of Congress: From 9:53 to 10:14 p.m., he spoke with Rep. H.L. ""Sonny"" Callahan. (184) In his Jones deposition on January 17, 1998, President Clinton -- who said he was unable to recall most of his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky -- did remember her ""back there with a pizza"" during the government shutdown. He said, however, that he did not believe that the two of them were alone. (185) Testifying before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, the President said that his first ""real conversation"" with Ms. Lewinsky occurred during the November 1995 furlough. He testified: ""One night she brought me some pizza. We had some remarks."" (186) E. December 31 Sexual Encounter According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had their third sexual encounter on New Year's Eve. Ms. Lewinsky -- by then a member of the staff of the Office of Legislative Affairs -- was at the White House on Sunday, December 31, 1995, until 1:16 p.m.; her time of arrival is not shown. (187) The President was in the Oval Office area from 12:11 p.m. until about the time that Ms. Lewinsky left, 1:15 p.m., when he went to the Residence. (188) Sometime between noon and 1 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she was in the pantry area of the President's private dining room talking with a White House steward, Bayani Nelvis. She told Mr. Nelvis that she had recently smoked her first cigar, and he offered to give her one of the President's cigars. Just then, the President came down the hallway from the Oval Office and saw Ms. Lewinsky. The President dispatched Mr. Nelvis to deliver something to Mr. Panetta. (189) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the President that Mr. Nelvis had promised her a cigar, and the President gave her one. (190) She told him her name -- she had the impression that he had forgotten it in the six weeks since their furlough encounters because, when passing her in the hallway, he had called her ""Kiddo."" (191) The President replied that he knew her name; in fact, he added, having lost the phone number she had given him, he had tried to find her in the phonebook. (192) According to Ms. Lewinsky, they moved to the study. ""And then . . . we were kissing and he lifted my sweater and exposed my breasts and was fondling them with his hands and with his mouth."" (193) She performed oral sex. (194) Once again, he stopped her before he ejaculated because, Ms. Lewinsky testified, ""he didn't know me well enough or he didn't trust me yet."" (195) According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Secret Service officer named Sandy was on duty in the West Wing that day. (196) Records show that Sandra Verna was on duty outside the Oval Office from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. (197) F. President's Account of 1995 Relationship As noted, the President testified before the grand jury that on November 17, 1995, Ms. Lewinsky delivered pizza and exchanged ""some remarks"" with him, but he never indicated that anything sexual occurred then or at any other point in 1995. (198) Testifying under oath before the grand jury, the President said that he engaged in ""conduct that was wrong"" involving ""inappropriate intimate contact"" with Ms. Lewinsky ""on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997."" (199) By implicitly denying any sexual contact in 1995, the President indicated that he and Ms. Lewinsky had no sexual involvement while she was an intern. (200) In the President's testimony, his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky ""began as a friendship,"" then later ""came to include this conduct."" (201) III. January-March 1996: Continued Sexual Encounters President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had additional sexual encounters near the Oval Office in 1996. After their sixth sexual encounter, the President and Ms. Lewinsky had their first lengthy conversation. On President's Day, February 19, the President terminated their sexual relationship, then revived it on March 31. A. January 7 Sexual Encounter According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had another sexual encounter on Sunday, January 7, 1996. Although White House records do not indicate that Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House that day, her testimony and other evidence indicate that she was there. (202) The President, according to White House records, was in the Oval Office most of the afternoon, from 2:13 to 5:49 p.m. (203) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her early that afternoon. It was the first time he had called her at home. (204) In her recollection: ""I asked him what he was doing and he said he was going to be going into the office soon. I said, oh, do you want some company? And he said, oh, that would be great."" (205) Ms. Lewinsky went to her office, and the President called to arrange their rendezvous: [W]e made an arrangement that . . . he would have the door to his office open, and I would pass by the office with some papers and then . . . he would sort of stop me and invite me in. So, that was exactly what happened. I passed by and that was actually when I saw [Secret Service Uniformed Officer] Lew Fox who was on duty outside the Oval Office, and stopped and spoke with Lew for a few minutes, and then the President came out and said, oh, hey, Monica . . . come on in . . . . And so we spoke for about 10 minutes in the [Oval] office. We sat on the sofas. Then we went into the back study and we were intimate in the bathroom. (206) Ms. Lewinsky testified that during this bathroom encounter, she and the President kissed, and he touched her bare breasts with his hands and his mouth. (207) The President ""was talking about performing oral sex on me,"" according to Ms. Lewinsky. (208) But she stopped him because she was menstruating and he did not. (209) Ms. Lewinsky did perform oral sex on him. (210) Afterward, she and the President moved to the Oval Office and talked. According to Ms. Lewinsky: ""[H]e was chewing on a cigar. And then he had the cigar in his hand and he was kind of looking at the cigar in . . . sort of a naughty way. And so . . . I looked at the cigar and I looked at him and I said, we can do that, too, some time."" (211) Corroborating aspects of Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, records show that Officer Fox was posted outside the Oval Office the afternoon of January 7. (212) Officer Fox (who is now retired) testified that he recalled an incident with Ms. Lewinsky one weekend afternoon when he was on duty by the Oval Office: (213) [T]he President of the United States came out, and he asked me, he says, ""Have you seen any young congressional staff members here today?"" I said, ""No, sir."" He said, ""Well, I'm expecting one."" He says, ""Would you please let me know when they show up?"" And I said, ""Yes, sir."" (214) Officer Fox construed the reference to ""congressional staff members"" to mean White House staff who worked with Congress -- i.e., staff of the Legislative Affairs Office, where Ms. Lewinsky worked. (215) Talking with a Secret Service agent posted in the hallway, Officer Fox speculated on whom the President was expecting: ""I described Ms. Lewinsky, without mentioning the name, in detail, dark hair -- you know, I gave a general description of what she looked like."" (216) Officer Fox had gotten to know Ms. Lewinsky during her tenure at the White House, and other agents had told him that she often spent time with the President. (217) A short time later, Ms. Lewinsky approached, greeted Officer Fox, and said, ""I have some papers for the President."" Officer Fox admitted her to the Oval Office. The President said: ""You can close the door. She'll be here for a while."" (218) B. January 21 Sexual Encounter On Sunday, January 21, 1996, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had another sexual encounter. Her time of White House entry is not reflected in records. She left at 3:56 p.m. (219) The President moved from the Residence to the Oval Office at 3:33 p.m. and remained there until 7:40 p.m. (220) On that day, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she saw the President in a hallway by an elevator, and he invited her to the Oval Office. (221) According to Ms. Lewinsky: We had . . . had phone sex for the first time the week prior, and I was feeling a little bit insecure about whether he had liked it or didn't like it . . . . I didn't know if this was sort of developing into some kind of a longer-term relationship than what I thought it initially might have been, that maybe he had some regular girlfriend who was furloughed . . . . (222) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she questioned the President about his interest in her. ""I asked him why he doesn't ask me any questions about myself, and . . . is this just about sex . . . or do you have some interest in trying to get to know me as a person?"" (223) The President laughed and said, according to Ms. Lewinsky, that ""he cherishes the time that he had with me."" (224) She considered it ""a little bit odd"" for him to speak of cherishing their time together ""when I felt like he didn't really even know me yet."" (225) They continued talking as they went to the hallway by the study. Then, with Ms. Lewinsky in mid-sentence, ""he just started kissing me."" (226) He lifted her top and touched her breasts with his hands and mouth. (227) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President ""unzipped his pants and sort of exposed himself,"" and she performed oral sex. (228) At one point during the encounter, someone entered the Oval Office. In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, ""[The President] zipped up real quickly and went out and came back in . . . . I just remember laughing because he had walked out there and he was visibly aroused, and I just thought it was funny."" (229) A short time later, the President got word that his next appointment, a friend from Arkansas, had arrived. (230) He took Ms. Lewinsky out through the Oval Office into Ms. Hernreich's office, where he kissed her goodbye. (231) C. February 4 Sexual Encounter and Subsequent Phone Calls On Sunday, February 4, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had their sixth sexual encounter and their first lengthy and personal conversation. The President was in the Oval Office from 3:36 to 7:05 p.m. (232) He had no telephone calls in the Oval Office before 4:45 p.m. (233) Records do not show Ms. Lewinsky's entry or exit. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at her desk and they planned their rendezvous. At her suggestion, they bumped into each other in the hallway, ""because when it happened accidentally, that seemed to work really well,"" then walked together to the area of the private study. (234) There, according to Ms. Lewinsky, they kissed. She was wearing a long dress that buttoned from the neck to the ankles. ""And he unbuttoned my dress and he unhooked my bra, and sort of took the dress off my shoulders and . . . moved the bra . . . . [H]e was looking at me and touching me and telling me how beautiful I was."" (235) He touched her breasts with his hands and his mouth, and touched her genitals, first through underwear and then directly. (236) She performed oral sex on him. (237) After their sexual encounter, the President and Ms. Lewinsky sat and talked in the Oval Office for about 45 minutes. Ms. Lewinsky thought the President might be responding to her suggestion during their previous meeting about ""trying to get to know me."" (238) It was during that conversation on February 4, according to Ms. Lewinsky, that their friendship started to blossom. (239) When she prepared to depart, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President ""kissed my arm and told me he'd call me, and then I said, yeah, well, what's my phone number? And so he recited both my home number and my office number off the top of his head."" (240) The President called her at her desk later that afternoon and said he had enjoyed their time together. (241) D. President's Day (February 19) Break-up According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President terminated their relationship (only temporarily, as it happened), on Monday, February 19, 1996 -- President's Day. The President was in the Oval Office from 11 a.m. to 2:01 p.m. that day. (242) He had no telephone calls between 12:19 and 12:42 p.m. (243) Records do not reflect Ms. Lewinsky's presence at the White House. In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, the President telephoned her at her Watergate apartment that day. From the tone of his voice, she could tell something was wrong. She asked to come see him, but he said he did not know how long he would be there. (244) Ms. Lewinsky went to the White House, then walked to the Oval Office sometime between noon and 2 p.m. (the only time she ever went to the Oval Office uninvited). (245) Ms. Lewinsky recalled that she was admitted by a tall, slender, Hispanic plainclothes agent on duty near the door. (246) The President told her that he no longer felt right about their intimate relationship, and he had to put a stop to it. (247) Ms. Lewinsky was welcome to continue coming to visit him, but only as a friend. He hugged her but would not kiss her. (248) At one point during their conversation, the President had a call from a sugar grower in Florida whose name, according to Ms. Lewinsky, was something like ""Fanuli."" In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, the President may have taken or returned the call just as she was leaving. (249) Ms. Lewinsky's account is corroborated in two respects. First, Nelson U. Garabito, a plainclothes Secret Service agent, testified that, on a weekend or holiday while Ms. Lewinsky worked at the White House (most likely in the early spring of 1996), Ms. Lewinsky appeared in the area of the Oval Office carrying a folder and said, ""I have these papers for the President."" (250) After knocking, Agent Garabito opened the Oval Office door, told the President he had a visitor, ushered Ms. Lewinsky in, and closed the door behind her. (251) When Agent Garabito's shift ended a few minutes later, Ms. Lewinsky was still in the Oval Office. (252) Second, concerning Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of a call from a sugar grower named ""Fanuli,"" the President talked with Alfonso Fanjul of Palm Beach, Florida, from 12:42 to 1:04 p.m. (253) Mr. Fanjul had telephoned a few minutes earlier, at 12:24 p.m. (254) The Fanjuls are prominent sugar growers in Florida. (255) E. Continuing Contacts After the break-up on February 19, 1996, according to Ms. Lewinsky, ""there continued to sort of be this flirtation . . . when we'd see each other."" (256) After passing Ms. Lewinsky in a hallway one night in late February or March, the President telephoned her at home and said he was disappointed that, because she had already left the White House for the evening, they could not get together. Ms. Lewinsky testified that the call ""sort of implied to me that he was interested in starting up again."" (257) On March 10, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky took a visiting friend, Natalie Ungvari, to the White House. They bumped into the President, who said to Ms. Ungvari when Ms. Lewinsky introduced them: ""You must be her friend from California."" (258) Ms. Ungvari was ""shocked"" that the President knew where she was from. (259) Ms. Lewinsky testified that on Friday, March 29, 1996, she was walking down a hallway when she passed the President, who was wearing the first necktie she had given him. She asked where he had gotten the tie, and he replied: ""Some girl with style gave it to me."" (260) Later, he telephoned her at her desk and asked if she would like to see a movie. His plan was that she would position herself in the hallway by the White House Theater at a certain time, and he would invite her to join him and a group of guests as they entered. Ms. Lewinsky responded that she did not want people to think she was lurking around the West Wing uninvited. (261) She asked if they could arrange a rendezvous over the weekend instead, and he said he would try. (262) Records confirm that the President spent the evening of March 29 in the White House Theater. (263) Mrs. Clinton was in Athens, Greece. (264) F. March 31 Sexual Encounter On Sunday, March 31, 1996, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President resumed their sexual contact. (265) Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House from 10:21 a.m. to 4:27 p.m. on that day. (266) The President was in the Oval Office from 3:00 to 5:46 p.m. (267) His only call while in the Oval Office was from 3:06 to 3:07 p.m. (268) Mrs. Clinton was in Ireland. (269) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at her desk and suggested that she come to the Oval Office on the pretext of delivering papers to him. (270) She went to the Oval Office and was admitted by a plainclothes Secret Service agent. (271) In her folder was a gift for the President, a Hugo Boss necktie. (272) In the hallway by the study, the President and Ms. Lewinsky kissed. On this occasion, according to Ms. Lewinsky, ""he focused on me pretty exclusively,"" kissing her bare breasts and fondling her genitals. (273) At one point, the President inserted a cigar into Ms. Lewinsky's vagina, then put the cigar in his mouth and said: ""It tastes good."" (274) After they were finished, Ms. Lewinsky left the Oval Office and walked through the Rose Garden. (275) IV. April 1996: Ms. Lewinsky's Transfer to the Pentagon With White House and Secret Service employees remarking on Ms. Lewinsky's frequent presence in the West Wing, a deputy chief of staff ordered Ms. Lewinsky transferred from the White House to the Pentagon. On April 7 -- Easter Sunday -- Ms. Lewinsky told the President of her dismissal. He promised to bring her back after the election, and they had a sexual encounter. A. Earlier Observations of Ms. Lewinsky in the West Wing Ms. Lewinsky's visits to the Oval Office area had not gone unnoticed. Officer Fox testified that ""it was pretty commonly known that she did frequent the West Wing on the weekends."" (276) Another Secret Service uniformed officer, William Ludtke III, once saw her exit from the pantry near the Oval Office; she seemed startled and possibly embarrassed to be spotted. (277) Officer John Muskett testified that ""if the President was known to be coming into the Diplomatic Reception Room, a lot of times [Ms. Lewinsky] just happened to be walking down the corridor, you know, maybe just to see the President."" (278) Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged that she tried to position herself to see the President. (279) Although they could not date them precisely, Secret Service officers and agents testified about several occasions when Ms. Lewinsky and the President were alone in the Oval Office. William C. Bordley, a former member of the Presidential Protective Detail, testified that in late 1995 or early 1996, he stopped Ms. Lewinsky outside the Oval Office because she did not have her pass. (280) The President opened the Oval Office door, indicated to Agent Bordley that Ms. Lewinsky's presence was all right, and ushered Ms. Lewinsky into the Oval Office. (281) Agent Bordley saw Ms. Lewinsky leave about half an hour later. (282) Another former member of the Presidential Protective Detail, Robert C. Ferguson, testified that one Saturday in winter, the President told him that he was expecting ""some staffers."" (283) A short time later, Ms. Lewinsky arrived and said that ""[t]he President needs me."" (284) Agent Ferguson announced Ms. Lewinsky and admitted her to the Oval Office. (285) About 10 or 15 minutes later, Agent Ferguson rotated to a post on the Colonnade outside the Oval Office. (286) He glanced through the window into the Oval Office and saw the President and Ms. Lewinsky go through the door leading toward the private study. (287) Deeming her frequent visits to the Oval Office area a ""nuisance,"" one Secret Service Officer complained to Evelyn Lieberman, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. (288) Ms. Lieberman was already aware of Ms. Lewinsky. In December 1995, according to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Lieberman chided her for being in the West Wing and told her that interns are not permitted around the Oval Office. Ms. Lewinsky (who had begun her Office of Legislative Affairs job) told Ms. Lieberman that she was not an intern anymore. After expressing surprise that Ms. Lewinsky had been hired, Ms. Lieberman said she must have Ms. Lewinsky confused with someone else. (289) Ms. Lieberman confirmed that she reprimanded Ms. Lewinsky, whom she considered ""what we used to call a 'clutch' . . . always someplace she shouldn't be."" (290) In Ms. Lewinsky's view, some White House staff members seemed to think that she was to blame for the President's evident interest in her: [P]eople were wary of his weaknesses, maybe, and . . . they didn't want to look at him and think that he could be responsible for anything, so it had to all be my fault . . . I was stalking him or I was making advances towards him. (292) B. Decision to Transfer Ms. Lewinsky Ms. Lieberman testified that, because Ms. Lewinsky was so persistent in her efforts to be near the President, ""I decided to get rid of her."" (293) First she consulted Chief of Staff Panetta. According to Mr. Panetta, Ms. Lieberman told him about a woman on the staff who was ""spending too much time around the West Wing."" Because of ""the appearance that it was creating,"" Ms. Lieberman proposed to move her out of the White House. Mr. Panetta -- who testified that he valued Ms. Lieberman's role as ""a tough disciplinarian"" and ""trusted her judgment"" -- replied, ""Fine."" (294) Although Ms. Lieberman said she could not recall having heard any rumors linking the President and Ms. Lewinsky, she acknowledged that ""the President was vulnerable to these kind of rumors . . . yes, yes, that was one of the reasons"" for moving Ms. Lewinsky out of the White House. (295) Later, in September 1997, Marcia Lewis (Ms. Lewinsky's mother) complained about her daughter's dismissal to Ms. Lieberman, whom she met at a Voice of America ceremony. Ms. Lieberman, according to Ms. Lewis, responded by ""saying something about Monica being cursed because she's beautiful."" Ms. Lewis gathered from the remark that Ms. Lieberman, as part of her effort to protect the President, ""would want to have pretty women moved out."" (296) Most people understood that the principal reason for Ms. Lewinsky's transfer was her habit of hanging around the Oval Office and the West Wing. (297) In a memo in October 1996, John Hilley, Assistant to the President and Director of Legislative Affairs, reported that Ms. Lewinsky had been ""got[ten] rid of"" in part ""because of 'extracurricular activities'"" (a phrase, he maintained in the grand jury, that meant only that Ms. Lewinsky was often absent from her work station). (298) White House officials arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to get another job in the Administration. (299) ""Our direction is to make sure she has a job in an Agency,"" Patsy Thomasson wrote in an email message on April 9, 1996. (300) Ms. Thomasson's office (Presidential Personnel) sent Ms. Lewinsky's resume to Charles Duncan, Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and White House Liaison, and asked him to find a Pentagon opening for her. (301) Mr. Duncan was told that, though Ms. Lewinsky had performed her duties capably, she was being dismissed for hanging around the Oval Office too much. (302) According to Mr. Duncan -- who had received as many as 40 job referrals per day from the White House -- the White House had never given such an explanation for a transfer. (303) C. Ms. Lewinsky's Notification of Her Transfer On Friday, April 5, 1996, Timothy Keating, Staff Director for Legislative Affairs, informed Ms. Lewinsky that she would have to leave her White House job. (304) According to Mr. Keating, he told her that she was not being fired, merely ""being given a different opportunity."" In fact, she could tell people it was a promotion if she cared to do so. (305) Upon hearing of her dismissal, Ms. Lewinsky burst into tears and asked if there was any way for her to stay in the White House, even without pay. (306) No, Mr. Keating said. According to Ms. Lewinsky, ""He told me I was too sexy to be working in the East Wing and that this job at the Pentagon where I'd be writing press releases was a sexier job."" (307) Ms. Lewinsky was devastated. She felt that she was being transferred simply because of her relationship with the President. (308) And she feared that with the loss of her White House job, ""I was never going to see the President again. I mean, my relationship with him would be over."" (309) D. Conversations with the President about Her Transfer 1. Easter Telephone Conversations and Sexual Encounter On Easter Sunday, April 7, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky told the President of her dismissal and they had a sexual encounter. Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 4:56 and left at 5:28 p.m. (310) The President was in the Oval Office all afternoon, from 2:21 to 7:48 p.m. (311) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at home that day. After they spoke of the death of the Commerce Secretary the previous week, she told him of her dismissal: I had asked him . . . if he was doing okay with Ron Brown's death, and then after we talked about that for a little bit I told him that my last day was Monday. And . . . he seemed really upset and sort of asked me to tell him what had happened. So I did and I was crying and I asked him if I could come see him, and he said that that was fine. (312) At the White House, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she told Secret Service Officer Muskett that she needed to deliver papers to the President. (313) Officer Muskett admitted her to the Oval Office, and she and the President proceeded to the private study. (314) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President seemed troubled about her upcoming departure from the White House: He told me that he thought that my being transferred had something to do with him and that he was upset. He said, ""Why do they have to take you away from me? I trust you."" And then he told me -- he looked at me and he said, ""I promise you if I win in November I'll bring you back like that."" (315) He also indicated that she could have any job she wanted after the election. (316) In addition, the President said he would find out why Ms. Lewinsky was transferred and report back to her. (317) When asked if he had promised to get Ms. Lewinsky another White House job, the President told the grand jury: What I told Ms. Lewinsky was that . . . I would do what I could to see, if she had a good record at the Pentagon, and she assured me she was doing a good job and working hard, that I would do my best to see that the fact that she had been sent away from the Legislative Affairs section did not keep her from getting a job in the White House, and that is, in fact, what I tried to do. . . . But I did not tell her I would order someone to hire her, and I never did, and I wouldn't do that. It wouldn't be right. (318) Ms. Lewinsky, when asked if the President had said that he would bring her back to the White House only if she did a good job at the Pentagon, responded: ""No."" (319) After this Easter Sunday conversation, the President and Ms. Lewinsky had a sexual encounter in the hallway, according to Ms. Lewinsky. (320) She testified that the President touched her breasts with his mouth and hands. (321) According to Ms. Lewinsky: ""I think he unzipped [his pants] . . . because it was sort of this running joke that I could never unbutton his pants, that I just had trouble with it."" (322) Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex. The President did not ejaculate in her presence. (323) During this encounter, someone called out from the Oval Office that the President had a phone call. (324) He went back to the Oval Office for a moment, then took the call in the study. The President indicated that Ms. Lewinsky should perform oral sex while he talked on the phone, and she obliged. (325) The telephone conversation was about politics, and Ms. Lewinsky thought the caller might be Dick Morris. (326) White House records confirm that the President had one telephone call during Ms. Lewinsky's visit: from ""Mr. Richard Morris,"" to whom he talked from 5:11 to 5:20 p.m. (327) A second interruption occurred a few minutes later, according to Ms. Lewinsky. She and the President were in the study. (328) Ms. Lewinsky testified: Harold Ickes has a very distinct voice and . . . I heard him holler ""Mr. President,"" and the President looked at me and I looked at him and he jetted out into the Oval Office and I panicked and . . . thought that maybe because Harold was so close with the President that they might just wander back there and the President would assume that I knew to leave. (329) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she exited hurriedly through the dining room door. (330) That evening, the President called and asked Ms. Lewinsky why she had run off. ""I told him that I didn't know if he was going to be coming back . . . . [H]e was a little upset with me that I left."" (331) In addition to the record of the Dick Morris phone call, the testimony of Secret Service Officer Muskett corroborates Ms. Lewinsky's account. Officer Muskett was posted near the door to the Oval Office on Easter Sunday. (332) He testified that Ms. Lewinsky (whom he knew) arrived at about 4:45 p.m. carrying a manila folder and seeming ""a little upset."" (333) She told Officer Muskett that she needed to deliver documents to the President. (334) Officer Muskett or the plainclothes agent on duty with him opened the door, and Ms. Lewinsky entered. (335) About 20 to 25 minutes later, according to Officer Muskett, the telephone outside the Oval Office rang. The White House operator said that the President had an important call but he was not picking up. (336) The agent working alongside Officer Muskett knocked on the door to the Oval Office. When the President did not respond, the agent entered. The Oval Office was empty, and the door leading to the study was slightly ajar. (337) (Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President left the door ajar during their sexual encounters. (338) ) The agent called out, ""Mr. President?"" There was no response. The agent stepped into the Oval Office and called out more loudly, ""Mr. President?"" This time there was a response from the study area, according to Officer Muskett: ""Huh?"" The agent called out that the President had a phone call, and the President said he would take it. (339) A few minutes later, according to Officer Muskett, Mr. Ickes approached and said he needed to see President Clinton. Officer Muskett admitted him through Ms. Currie's office. (340) Less than a minute after Mr. Ickes entered Ms. Currie's reception area, according to Officer Muskett, the pantry or dining room door closed audibly. Officer Muskett stepped down the hall to check and saw Ms. Lewinsky walking away briskly. (341) At 5:30 p.m., two minutes after Ms. Lewinsky left the White House, the President called the office of the person who had decided to transfer Ms. Lewinsky, Evelyn Lieberman. (342) 2. April 12-13: Telephone Conversations Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President telephoned her the following Friday, April 12, 1996, at home. They talked for about 20 minutes. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said he had checked on the reason for her transfer: [H]e had come to learn . . . that Evelyn Lieberman had sort of spearheaded the transfer, and that she thought he was paying too much attention to me and I was paying too much attention to him and that she didn't necessarily care what happened after the election but everyone needed to be careful before the election. (343) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her to give the Pentagon a try, and, if she did not like it, he would get her a job on the campaign. (344) In the grand jury, Ms. Lieberman testified that the President asked her directly about Ms. Lewinsky's transfer: After I had gotten rid of her, when I was in there, during the course of a conversation, [President Clinton] said, ""I got a call about --"" I don't know if he said her name. He said maybe ""-- an intern you fired."" And she was evidently very upset about it. He said, ""Do you know anything about this?"" I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Who fired her?"" I said, ""I did."" And he said, ""Oh, okay."" (345) According to Ms. Lieberman, the President did not pursue the matter further. (346) Three other witnesses confirm that the President knew why Ms. Lewinsky was transferred to the Pentagon. In 1997, the President told Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles ""that there was a young woman -- her name was Monica Lewinsky -- who used to work at the White House; that Evelyn . . . thought she hung around the Oval Office too much and transferred her to the Pentagon."" (347) According to Betty Currie, the President believed that Ms. Lewinsky had been unfairly transferred. (348) The President's close friend, Vernon Jordan, testified that the President said to him in December 1997 that ""he knew about [Ms. Lewinsky's] situation, which was that she was pushed out of the White House."" (349) V. April-December 1996: No Private Meetings After Ms. Lewinsky began her Pentagon job on April 16, 1996, she had no further physical contact with the President for the remainder of the year. She and the President spoke by phone (and had phone sex) but saw each other only at public functions. Ms. Lewinsky grew frustrated after the election because the President did not bring her back to work at the White House. A. Pentagon Job On April 16, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky began working at the Pentagon as Confidential Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. (350) B. No Physical Contact According to Ms. Lewinsky, she had no physical contact with the President for the rest of 1996. (351) ""I wasn't alone with him so when I saw him it was in some sort of event or group setting,"" she testified. (352) C. Telephone Conversations Ms. Lewinsky and the President did talk by telephone, especially in her first weeks at the new job. (353) By Ms. Lewinsky's estimate, the President phoned her (sometimes leaving a message) four or five times in the month after she started working at the Pentagon, then two or three times a month thereafter for the rest of 1996. (354) During the fall 1996 campaign, the President sometimes called from trips when Mrs. Clinton was not accompanying him. (355) During at least seven of the 1996 calls, Ms. Lewinsky and the President had phone sex. (356) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at about 6:30 a.m. on July 19, the day he was leaving for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and they had phone sex, after which the President exclaimed, ""[G]ood morning!"" and then said: ""What a way to start a day."" (357) A call log shows that the President called the White House operator at 12:11 a.m. on July 19 and asked for a wake-up call at 7 a.m., then at 6:40 a.m., the President called and said he was already up. (358) In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she and the President also had phone sex on May 21, July 5 or 6, October 22, and December 2, 1996. (359) On those dates, Mrs. Clinton was in Denver (May 21), Prague and Budapest (July 5-6), Las Vegas (October 22), and en route to Bolivia (December 2). (360) Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly told the President that she disliked her Pentagon job and wanted to return to the White House. (361) In a recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky recounted one call: [A] month had passed and -- so he had called one night, and I said, ""Well,"" I said, ""I'm really unhappy,"" you know. And [the President] said, ""I don't want to talk about your job tonight. I'll call you this week, and then we'll talk about it. I want to talk about other things"" -- which meant phone sex. (362) She expected to talk with him the following weekend, and she was ""ready to broach the idea of . . . going to the campaign,"" but he did not call. (363) Ms. Lewinsky and the President also talked about their relationship. During a phone conversation on September 5, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the President that she wanted to have intercourse with him. He responded that he could not do so because of the possible consequences. The two of them argued, and he asked if he should stop calling her. No, she responded. (364) D. Public Encounters During this period, Ms. Lewinsky occasionally saw the President in public. She testified: I'm an insecure person . . . and I was insecure about the relationship at times and thought that he would come to forget me easily and if I hadn't heard from him . . . it was very difficult for me . . . . [U]sually when I'd see him, it would kind of prompt him to call me. So I made an effort. I would go early and stand in the front so I could see him . . . . (365) On May 2, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky saw the President at a reception for the Saxophone Club, a political organization. (366) On June 14, Ms. Lewinsky and her family attended the taping of the President's weekly radio address and had photos taken with the President. (367) On August 18, Ms. Lewinsky attended the President's 50th birthday party at Radio City Music Hall, and she got into a cocktail party for major donors where she saw the President. (368) According to Ms. Lewinsky, when the President reached past her at the rope line to shake hands with another guest, she reached out and touched his crotch in a ""playful"" fashion. (369) On October 23, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she talked with the President at a fundraiser for Senate Democrats. (370) The two were photographed together at the event. (371) The President was wearing a necktie she had given him, according to Ms. Lewinsky, and she said to him, ""Hey, Handsome -- I like your tie."" (372) The President telephoned her that night. She said she planned to be at the White House on Pentagon business the next day, and he told her to stop by the Oval Office. At the White House the next day, Ms. Lewinsky did not see the President because Ms. Lieberman was nearby. (373) On December 17, Ms. Lewinsky attended a holiday reception at the White House. (374) A photo shows her shaking hands with the President. (375) E. Ms. Lewinsky's Frustrations Continuing to believe that her relationship with the President was the key to regaining her White House pass, Ms. Lewinsky hoped that the President would get her a job immediately after the election. ""I kept a calendar with a countdown until election day,"" she later wrote in an unsent letter to him. The letter states: I was so sure that the weekend after the election you would call me to come visit and you would kiss me passionately and tell me you couldn't wait to have me back. You'd ask me where I wanted to work and say something akin to ""Consider it done"" and it would be. Instead I didn't hear from you for weeks and subsequently your phone calls became less frequent. (376) Ms. Lewinsky grew increasingly frustrated over her relationship with President Clinton. (377) One friend understood that Ms. Lewinsky complained to the President about not having seen each other privately for months, and he replied, ""Every day can't be sunshine."" (378) In email to another friend in early 1997, Ms. Lewinsky wrote: ""I just don't understand what went wrong, what happened? How could he do this to me? Why did he keep up contact with me for so long and now nothing, now when we could be together?"" (379) VI. Early 1997: Resumption of Sexual Encounters In 1997, President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had further private meetings, which now were arranged by Betty Currie, the President's secretary. After the taping of the President's weekly radio address on February 28, the President and Ms. Lewinsky had a sexual encounter. On March 24, they had what proved to be their final sexual encounter. Throughout this period, Ms. Lewinsky continued to press for a job at the White House, to no avail. A. Resumption of Meetings with the President 1. Role of Betty Currie a. Arranging Meetings In 1997, with the presidential election past, Ms. Lewinsky and the President resumed their one-on-one meetings and sexual encounters. The President's secretary, Betty Currie, acted as intermediary. According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky would often call her and say she wanted to see the President, sometimes to discuss a particular topic. (380) Ms. Currie would ask President Clinton, and, if he agreed, arrange the meeting. (381) Ms. Currie also said it was ""not unusual"" that Ms. Lewinsky would talk by phone with the President and then call Ms. Currie to set up a meeting. (382) At times, Ms. Currie placed calls to Ms. Lewinsky for President Clinton and put him on the line. (383) The meetings between the President and Ms. Lewinsky often occurred on weekends. (384) When Ms. Lewinsky would arrive at the White House, Ms. Currie generally would be the one to authorize her entry and take her to the West Wing. (385) Ms. Currie acknowledged that she sometimes would come to the White House for the sole purpose of having Ms. Lewinsky admitted and bringing her to see the President. (386) According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky and the President were alone together in the Oval Office or the study for 15 to 20 minutes on multiple occasions. (387) Secret Service officers and agents took note of Ms. Currie's role. Officer Steven Pape once observed Ms. Currie come to the White House for the duration of Ms. Lewinsky's visit, then leave. (388) When calling to alert the officer at the West Wing lobby that Ms. Lewinsky was en route, Ms. Currie would sometimes say, ""[Y]ou know who it is."" (389) On one occasion, Ms. Currie instructed Officer Brent Chinery to hold Ms. Lewinsky at the lobby for a few minutes because she needed to move the President to the study. (390) On another occasion, Ms. Currie told Officer Chinery to have Ms. Lewinsky held at the gate for 30 to 40 minutes because the President already had a visitor. (391) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she once asked the President why Ms. Currie had to clear her in, and why he could not do so himself. ""[H]e said because if someone comes to see him, there's a list circulated among the staff members and then everyone would be questioning why I was there to see him."" (392) b. Intermediary for Gifts Ms. Lewinsky also sent over a number of packages -- six or eight, Ms. Currie estimated. (393) According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky would call and say she was sending something for the President. (394) The package would arrive addressed to Ms. Currie. (395) Courier receipts show that Ms. Lewinsky sent seven packages to the White House between October 7 and December 8, 1997. (396) Evidence indicates that Ms. Lewinsky on occasion also dropped parcels off with Ms. Currie or had a family member do so, (397) and brought gifts to the President when visiting him. (398) Ms. Currie testified that most packages from Ms. Lewinsky were intended for the President. (399) Although Ms. Currie generally opened letters and parcels to the President, she did not open these packages from Ms. Lewinsky. (400) She testified that ""I made the determination not to open"" such letters and packages because ""I felt [they were] probably personal."" (401) Instead, she would leave the package in the President's box, and ""[h]e would pick it up."" (402) To the best of her knowledge, such parcels always reached the President. (403) c. Secrecy Ms. Currie testified that she suspected impropriety in the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. (404) She told the grand jury that she ""had concern."" In her words: ""[H]e was spending a lot of time with a 24-year-old young lady. I know he has said that young people keep him involved in what's happening in the world, so I knew that was one reason, but there was a concern of mine that she was spending more time than most."" (405) Ms. Currie understood that ""the majority"" of the President's meetings with Ms. Lewinsky were ""more personal in nature as opposed to business."" (406) Ms. Currie also testified that she tried to avoid learning details of the relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. On one occasion, Ms. Lewinsky said of herself and the President, ""As long as no one saw us -- and no one did -- then nothing happened."" Ms. Currie responded: ""Don't want to hear it. Don't say any more. I don't want to hear any more."" (407) Ms. Currie helped keep the relationship secret. When the President wanted to talk with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie would dial the call herself rather than go through White House operators, who keep logs of presidential calls made through the switchboard. (408) When Ms. Lewinsky phoned and Ms. Currie put the President on the line, she did not log the call, though the standard procedure was to note all calls, personal and professional. (409) According to Secret Service uniformed officers, Ms. Currie sometimes tried to persuade them to admit Ms. Lewinsky to the White House compound without making a record of it. (410) In addition, Ms. Currie avoided writing down or retaining most messages from Ms. Lewinsky to the President. In response to a grand jury subpoena, the White House turned over only one note to the President concerning Ms. Lewinsky -- whereas evidence indicates that Ms. Lewinsky used Ms. Currie to convey requests and messages to the President on many occasions. (411) When bringing Ms. Lewinsky in from the White House gate, Ms. Currie said she sometimes chose a path that would reduce the likelihood of being seen by two White House employees who disapproved of Ms. Lewinsky: Stephen Goodin and Nancy Hernreich. (412) Ms. Currie testified that she once brought Ms. Lewinsky directly to the study, ""sneaking her back"" via a roundabout path to avoid running into Mr. Goodin. (413) When Ms. Lewinsky visited the White House on weekends and at night, being spotted was not a problem -- in Ms. Currie's words, ""there would be no need to sneak"" -- so Ms. Lewinsky would await the President in Ms. Currie's office. (414) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she once expressed concern about records showing the President's calls to her, and Ms. Currie told her not to worry. (415) Ms. Lewinsky also suspected that Ms. Currie was not logging in all of her gifts to the President. (416) In Ms. Lewinsky's evaluation, many White House staff members tried to regulate the President's behavior, but Ms. Currie generally did as he wished. (417) 2. Observations by Secret Service Officers Officers of the Secret Service Uniformed Division noted Ms. Lewinsky's 1997 visits to the White House. From radio traffic about the President's movements, several officers observed that the President often would head for the Oval Office within minutes of Ms. Lewinsky's entry to the complex, especially on weekends, and some noted that he would return to the Residence a short time after her departure. (418) ""It was just like clockwork,"" according to one officer. (419) Concerned about the President's reputation, another officer suggested putting Ms. Lewinsky on a list of people who were not to be admitted to the White House. A commander responded that it was none of their business whom the President chose to see, and, in any event, nobody would ever find out about Ms. Lewinsky. (420) B. Valentine's Day Advertisement On February 14, 1997, the Washington Post published a Valentine's Day ""Love Note"" that Ms. Lewinsky had placed. The ad said: HANDSOME With love's light wings did I o'er perch these walls For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt. -- Romeo and Juliet 2:2 Happy Valentine's Day. M (421) C. February 24 Message On February 24, Ms. Lewinsky visited the White House on Pentagon business. (422) She went by Ms. Currie's office. (423) Ms. Currie sent a note to the President -- the only such note turned over by the White House in response to a grand jury subpoena: ""Monica Lewinsky stopped by. Do you want me to call her?"" (424) D. February 28 Sexual Encounter According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had a sexual encounter on Thursday, February 28 -- their first in nearly 11 months. White House records show that Ms. Lewinsky attended the taping of the President's weekly radio address on February 28. (425) She was at the White House from 5:48 to 7:07 p.m. (426) The President was in the Roosevelt Room (where the radio address was taped) from 6:29 to 6:36 p.m., then moved to the Oval Office, where he remained until 7:24 p.m. (427) He had no telephone calls while Ms. Lewinsky was in the White House. (428) Wearing a navy blue dress from the Gap, Ms. Lewinsky attended the radio address at the President's invitation (relayed by Ms. Currie), then had her photo taken with the President. (429) Ms. Lewinsky had not been alone with the President since she had worked at the White House, and, she testified, ""I was really nervous."" (430) President Clinton told her to see Ms. Currie after the photo was taken because he wanted to give her something. (431) ""So I waited a little while for him and then Betty and the President and I went into the back office,"" Ms. Lewinsky testified. (432) (She later learned that the reason Ms. Currie accompanied them was that Stephen Goodin did not want the President to be alone with Ms. Lewinsky, a view that Mr. Goodin expressed to the President and Ms. Currie. (433) ) Once they had passed from the Oval Office toward the private study, Ms. Currie said, ""I'll be right back,"" and walked on to the back pantry or the dining room, where, according to Ms. Currie, she waited for 15 to 20 minutes while the President and Ms. Lewinsky were in the study. (434) Ms. Currie (who said she acted on her own initiative) testified that she accompanied the President and Ms. Lewinsky out of the Oval Office because ""I didn't want any perceptions, him being alone with someone."" (435) In the study, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President ""started to say something to me and I was pestering him to kiss me, because . . . it had been a long time since we had been alone."" (436) The President told her to wait a moment, as he had presents for her. (437) As belated Christmas gifts, he gave her a hat pin and a special edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass . (438) Ms. Lewinsky described the Whitman book as ""the most sentimental gift he had given me . . . it's beautiful and it meant a lot to me."" (439) During this visit, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said he had seen her Valentine's Day message in the Washington Post , and he talked about his fondness for ""Romeo and Juliet."" (440) Ms. Lewinsky testified that after the President gave her the gifts, they had a sexual encounter: [W]e went back over by the bathroom in the hallway, and we kissed. We were kissing and he unbuttoned my dress and fondled my breasts with my bra on, and then took them out of my bra and was kissing them and touching them with his hands and with his mouth. And then I think I was touching him in his genital area through his pants, and I think I unbuttoned his shirt and was kissing his chest. And then . . . I wanted to perform oral sex on him . . . and so I did. And then . . . I think he heard something, or he heard someone in the office. So, we moved into the bathroom. And I continued to perform oral sex and then he pushed me away, kind of as he always did before he came, and then I stood up and I said . . . I care about you so much; . . . I don't understand why you won't let me . . . make you come; it's important to me; I mean, it just doesn't feel complete, it doesn't seem right. (441) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President hugged, and ""he said he didn't want to get addicted to me, and he didn't want me to get addicted to him."" They looked at each other for a moment. (442) Then, saying that ""I don't want to disappoint you,"" the President consented. (443) For the first time, she performed oral sex through completion. (444) When Ms. Lewinsky next took the navy blue Gap dress from her closet to wear it, she noticed stains near one hip and on the chest. (445) FBI Laboratory tests revealed that the stains are the President's semen. (446) In his grand jury testimony, the President -- who, because the OIC had asked him for a blood sample (and had represented that it had ample evidentiary justification for making such a request), had reason to suspect that Ms. Lewinsky's dress might bear traces of his semen -- indicated that he and Ms. Lewinsky had had sexual contact on the day of the radio address. He testified: I was sick after it was over and I, I was pleased at that time that it had been nearly a year since any inappropriate contact had occurred with Ms. Lewinsky. I promised myself it wasn't going to happen again. The facts are complicated about what did happen and how it happened. But, nonetheless, I'm responsible for it. (447) Later the President added, referring to the evening of the radio address: ""I do believe that I was alone with her from 15 to 20 minutes. I do believe that things happened then which were inappropriate."" (448) He said of the intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky: ""I never should have started it, and I certainly shouldn't have started it back after I resolved not to in 1996."" (449) E. March 29 Sexual Encounter According to Ms. Lewinsky, she had what proved to be her final sexual encounter with the President on Saturday, March 29, 1997. Records show that she was at the White House from 2:03 to 3:16 p.m., admitted by Ms. Currie. (450) The President was in the Oval Office during this period (he left shortly after Ms. Lewinsky did, at 3:24 p.m.), and he did not have any phone calls during her White House visit. (451) According to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie arranged the meeting after the President said by telephone that he had something important to tell her. At the White House, Ms. Currie took her to the study to await the President. He came in on crutches, the result of a knee injury in Florida two weeks earlier. (452) According to Ms. Lewinsky, their sexual encounter began with a sudden kiss: ""[T]his was another one of those occasions when I was babbling on about something, and he just kissed me, kind of to shut me up, I think."" (453) The President unbuttoned her blouse and touched her breasts without removing her bra. (454) ""[H]e went to go put his hand down my pants, and then I unzipped them because it was easier. And I didn't have any panties on. And so he manually stimulated me."" (455) According to Ms. Lewinsky, ""I wanted him to touch my genitals with his genitals,"" and he did so, lightly and without penetration. (456) Then Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on him, again until he ejaculated. (457) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had a lengthy conversation that day. He told her that he suspected that a foreign embassy (he did not specify which one) was tapping his telephones, and he proposed cover stories. If ever questioned, she should say that the two of them were just friends. If anyone ever asked about their phone sex, she should say that they knew their calls were being monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on. (458) In his grand jury testimony, the President implicitly denied this encounter. He acknowledged ""inappropriate intimate contact"" with Ms. Lewinsky ""on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997."" (459) The President indicated that ""the one occasion in 1997"" was the radio address. (460) F. Continuing Job Efforts With the 1996 election past, meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky had continued striving to get a job at the White House. She testified that she first broached the issue in a telephone call with the President in January 1997, and he said he would speak to Bob Nash, Director of Presidential Personnel. (461) She understood that Mr. Nash was supposed to ""find a position for me to come back to the White House."" (462) Over the months that followed, Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly asked the President to get her a White House job. In her recollection, the President replied that various staff members were working on it, including Mr. Nash and Marsha Scott, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director for Presidential Personnel. (463) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her: ""Bob Nash is handling it,"" ""Marsha's going to handle it"" and ""We just sort of need to be careful."" You know, and . . . he would always sort of . . . validate what I was feeling by telling me something that I don't necessarily know is true. ""Oh, I'll talk to her,"" ""I'll -- you know, I'll see blah, blah, blah,"" and it was just ""I'll do,"" ""I'll do,"" ""I'll do."" And didn't, didn't, didn't. (464) Ms. Lewinsky came to wonder if she was being ""strung along."" (465) Testifying before the grand jury, the President acknowledged that Ms. Lewinsky had complained to him about her job situation: You know, she tried for months and months to get a job back in the White House, not so much in the West Wing but somewhere in the White House complex, including the Old Executive Office Building. . . . She very much wanted to come back. And she interviewed for some jobs but never got one. She was, from time to time, upset about it. (466) VII. May 1997: Termination of Sexual Relationship In May 1997, amid indications that Ms. Lewinsky had been indiscreet, President Clinton terminated the sexual relationship. A. Questions about Ms. Lewinsky's Discretion In April or May 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President asked if she had told her mother about their intimate relationship. She responded: ""No. Of course not."" (468) (In truth, she had told her mother. (469) ) The President indicated that Ms. Lewinsky's mother possibly had said something about the nature of the relationship to Walter Kaye, who had mentioned it to Marsha Scott, who in turn had alerted the President. (470) Corroborating Ms. Lewinsky's account, Mr. Kaye testified that he told Ms. Lewinsky's aunt, Debra Finerman, that he understood that ""her niece was very aggressive,"" a remark that angered Ms. Finerman. Ms. Finerman told Mr. Kaye that the President was the true aggressor: He was telephoning Ms. Lewinsky late at night. Ms. Finerman, in Mr. Kaye's recollection, attributed this information to Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother (and Ms. Finerman's sister). Mr. Kaye -- who had disbelieved stories he had heard from Democratic National Committee people about an affair between Ms. Lewinsky and the President -- testified that he was ""shocked"" to hear of the late-night phone calls. (471) B. May 24: Break-up On Saturday, May 24, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President ended their intimate relationship. Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House that day from 12:21 to 1:54 p.m. (472) The President was in the Oval Office during most of this period, from 11:59 a.m. to 1:47 p.m. (473) He did not have any telephone calls. (474) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she got a call from Ms. Currie at about 11 a.m. that day, inviting her to come to the White House at about 1 p.m. Ms. Lewinsky arrived wearing a straw hat with the hat pin the President had given her, and bringing gifts for him, including a puzzle and a Banana Republic shirt. She gave him the gifts in the dining room, and they moved to the area of the study. (475) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President explained that they had to end their intimate relationship. (476) Earlier in his marriage, he told her, he had had hundreds of affairs; but since turning 40, he had made a concerted effort to be faithful. (477) He said he was attracted to Ms. Lewinsky, considered her a great person, and hoped they would remain friends. He pointed out that he could do a great deal for her. The situation, he stressed, was not Ms. Lewinsky's fault. (478) Ms. Lewinsky, weeping, tried to persuade the President not to end the sexual relationship, but he was unyielding, then and subsequently. (479) Although she and the President kissed and hugged thereafter, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the sexual relationship was over. (480) Three days after this meeting, on May 27, 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected President Clinton's claim that the Constitution immunized him from civil lawsuits. The Court ordered the sexual harassment case Jones v. Clinton to proceed. (481) VIII. June-October 1997: Continuing Meetings and Calls Ms. Lewinsky tried to return to the White House staff and to revive her sexual relationship with the President, but she failed at both. A. Continuing Job Efforts Although Ms. Lewinsky was not offered another White House job, some testimony indicates that the President tried to get her one. According to Betty Currie, the President instructed her and Marsha Scott to help Ms. Lewinsky find a White House job. (482) Ms. Currie testified that she resisted the request, because her opinion of Ms. Lewinsky had shifted over time. At first, she testified, she considered Ms. Lewinsky ""a friend"" who ""had been wronged"" and had been ""maligned improperly."" (483) But ""[l]ater on, I considered her as a pain in the neck, more or less."" (484) The change of heart resulted in part from Ms. Currie's many phone calls in 1997 from Ms. Lewinsky, who was often distraught and sometimes in tears over her inability to get in touch with the President. (485) Deeming her ""a little bit pushy,"" Ms. Currie argued against bringing Ms. Lewinsky back to work at the White House, but the President told her and Ms. Scott, in Ms. Currie's words, ""to still pursue her coming back."" (486) Indeed, according to Ms. Currie, the President ""was pushing us hard"" on the matter. (487) To the best of Ms. Currie's recollection, it was the only time the President instructed her to try to get someone a White House job. (488) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her to talk with Ms. Scott about a White House job in spring 1997. (489) On June 16, she met with Ms. Scott. (490) The meeting did not go as Ms. Lewinsky anticipated. She later recounted in an email message: There is most certainly a disconnect on what [the President] said he told her and how she acted. She didn't even know what my title or my job was . . . . She didn't have any job openings to offer. Instead, she made me go over what happened when I had to leave (who told me), and then proceeded to confirm the Evelyn [Lieberman] story about my ""inappropriate behavior."" Then she asked me: with such nasty women there and people gossiping about me, why did I want to come back? I was so upset. I really did not feel it was her place to question me about that. Later on, I said something about being told I could come back after November and she wanted to know who told me that! So I have placed a call to him but I don't know what is going to happen. Ms. Lewinsky added that she was inclined ""to walk away from it all,"" but acknowledged that ""I'm always saying this and then I change my mind."" (491) Though she characterized her recollection as ""all jumbled,"" Ms. Scott corroborated much of Ms. Lewinsky's account. (492) Ms. Scott said that at some point she did ask Ms. Lewinsky why she wanted to return to the White House. (493) Ms. Scott also said that she was unaware of Ms. Lewinsky's job title before their meeting. (494) Over the next three weeks, Ms. Lewinsky tried repeatedly, without success, to talk with the President about her job quest. In a draft of a letter to Ms. Currie, she wrote that the President ""said to me that he had told [Ms. Scott] I had gotten a bum deal, and I should get a good job in the West Wing,"" but Ms. Scott did not seem eager to arrange for Ms. Lewinsky's return. Ms. Lewinsky wrote: I was surprised that she would question his judgment and not just do what he asked of her. Is it possible that, in fact, he did not tell her that? Does he really not want me back in the complex? He has not responded to my note, nor has he called me. Do you know what is going on? If so, are you able to share it with me? (495) Ms. Currie testified to ""a vague recollection"" of having seen this letter. (496) On June 29, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky wrote several notes. In a draft letter to Ms. Scott, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that ""our last conversation was very upsetting to me,"" and added: Marsha, I was told that I could come back after the election. I knew why I had to leave last year by mid-April, and I have been beyond patient since then. I do not think it is fair to . . . be told by the person whom I was told would get me a job that there is nothing for me and she doesn't really hear about positions [in] the complex anyway. I know that in your eyes I am just a hindrance -- a woman who doesn't have a certain someone's best interests at heart, but please trust me when I say I do. (497) Ms. Lewinsky also drafted a note to the President pleading for a brief meeting the following Tuesday. Referring to her inability to get in touch with him, she wrote: "" Please do not do this to me. I feel disposable, used and insignificant. I understand your hands are tied, but I want to talk to you and look at some options."" (498) Around this time, Ms. Lewinsky told a friend that she was considering moving to another city or country. (499) B. July 3 Letter ""[V]ery frustrated"" over her inability to get in touch with the President to discuss her job situation, Ms. Lewinsky wrote him a peevish letter on July 3, 1997. (500) Opening ""Dear Sir,"" the letter took the President to task for breaking his promise to get her another White House job. (501) Ms. Lewinsky also obliquely threatened to disclose their relationship. If she was not going to return to work at the White House, she wrote, then she would ""need to explain to my parents exactly why that wasn't happening."" Some explanation was necessary because she had told her parents that she would be brought back after the election. (502) (Ms. Lewinsky testified that she would not actually have told her father about the relationship -- she had already told her mother -- but she wanted to remind the President that she had ""left the White House like a good girl in April of '96,"" whereas other people might have threatened disclosure in order to retain the job. (503) ) Ms. Lewinsky also raised the possibility of a job outside Washington. If returning to the White House was impossible, she asked in this letter, could he get her a job at the United Nations in New York? (504) It was the first time that she had told the President that she was considering moving. (505) Although not questioned about this particular letter, the President testified that he believed Ms. Lewinsky might disclose their intimate relationship once he stopped it. He testified: After I terminated the improper contact with her, she wanted to come in more than she did. She got angry when she didn't get in sometimes. I knew that that might make her more likely to speak, and I still did it because I had to limit the contact. (506) After receiving the July 3 letter, though, the President agreed to see Ms. Lewinsky. In her account, Ms. Currie called that afternoon and told her to come to the White House at 9 a.m. the next day. (507) C. July 4 Meeting On Friday, July 4, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky had what she characterized as a ""very emotional"" visit with the President. (508) Records show that Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 8:51 a.m.; no exit time is recorded. (509) Logs indicate that the President was in the Oval Office from 8:40 until after 11 a.m. (510) In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, their meeting began contentiously, with the President scolding her: ""[I]t's illegal to threaten the President of the United States."" (511) He then told her that he had not read her July 3 letter beyond the ""Dear Sir"" line; he surmised that it was threatening because Ms. Currie looked upset when she brought it to him. (Ms. Lewinsky suspected that he actually had read the whole thing.) (512) Ms. Lewinsky complained about his failure to get her a White House job after her long wait. Although the President claimed he wanted to be her friend, she said, he was not acting like it. Ms. Lewinsky began weeping, and the President hugged her. While they hugged, she spotted a gardener outside the study window, and they moved into the hallway by the bathroom. (513) There, the President was ""the most affectionate with me he'd ever been,"" Ms. Lewinsky testified. He stroked her arm, toyed with her hair, kissed her on the neck, praised her intellect and beauty. (514) In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection: [H]e remarked . . . that he wished he had more time for me. And so I said, well, maybe you will have more time in three years. And I was . . . thinking just when he wasn't President, he was going to have more time on his hands. And he said, well, I don't know, I might be alone in three years. And then I said something about . . . us sort of being together. I think I kind of said, oh, I think we'd be a good team, or something like that. And he . . . jokingly said, well, what are we going to do when I'm 75 and I have to pee 25 times a day? And . . . I told him that we'd deal with that. . . . (515) Ms. Lewinsky testified that ""I left that day sort of emotionally stunned,"" for ""I just knew he was in love with me."" (516) Just before leaving, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the President ""that I wanted to talk to him about something serious and that while I didn't want to be the one to talk about this with him, I thought it was important he know."" (517) She informed him that Newsweek was working on an article about Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer who claimed that the President had sexually harassed her during a private meeting in the Oval Office on November 23, 1993. (Ms. Lewinsky knew of the article from Ms. Tripp, who had worked at the White House at the time of the alleged incident and had heard about the incident from Ms. Willey. Michael Isikoff of Newsweek had talked with Ms. Tripp about the episode in March 1997 and again shortly before July 4, and Ms. Tripp had subsequently related the Isikoff conversations to Ms. Lewinsky. (518) ) Ms. Lewinsky told the President what she had learned from Ms. Tripp (whom she did not name), including the fact that Ms. Tripp had tried to get in touch with Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey, who had not returned her calls. (519) Ms. Lewinsky testified about why she conveyed this information to the President: ""I was concerned that the President had no idea this was going on and that this woman was going to be another Paula Jones and he didn't really need that."" (520) She understood that Ms. Willey was looking for a job, and she thought that the President might be able to ""make this go away"" by finding her a job. (521) The President responded that the harassment allegation was ludicrous, because he would never approach a small-breasted woman like Ms. Willey. (522) He further said that, during the previous week, Ms. Willey had called Nancy Hernreich to warn that a reporter was working on a story about Ms. Willey and the President; Ms. Willey wondered how she could get out of it. (523) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President had no telephone calls during her time with him. At 10:19 a.m., probably after her departure (her exit time is not shown on logs), he placed two calls, both potentially follow-ups to the conversation about the Newsweek article. First, he spoke with Bruce Lindsey for three minutes, then with Nancy Hernreich for 11 minutes. (524) D. July 14-15 Discussions of Linda Tripp On the evening of Monday, July 14, 1997, just after Ms. Lewinsky had returned from an overseas trip, the President had her come to the White House to discuss Linda Tripp and Newsweek . (525) Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 9:34 p.m. and exited at 11:22 p.m. (526) The President was in the Oval Office area from 9:28 to 11:25 p.m. (527) Ms. Lewinsky testified that, at around 7:30 p.m. that evening, Ms. Currie telephoned and said that the President wanted to talk to her or see her. At about 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., Ms. Currie called again and asked Ms. Lewinsky to come to the White House. (528) Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President met her in Ms. Currie's office, then took her into Ms. Hernreich's office. (529) (Records show that seven minutes after Ms. Lewinsky's entry to the White House complex, the President left the Oval Office for the appointment secretary's office.) (530) According to Ms. Lewinsky: It was an unusual meeting . . . . It was very distant and very cold. . . . [A]t one point he asked me if the woman that I had mentioned on July 4th was Linda Tripp. And I hesitated and then answered yes, and he talked about that there was some issue . . . to do with Kathleen Willey and that, as he called it, that there was something on the Sludge Report, that there had been some information. (531) The President told Ms. Lewinsky that Ms. Willey had called the White House again, this time to report that Mr. Isikoff somehow knew of her earlier White House call. (532) The President wondered if Ms. Lewinsky had mentioned the Willey call to Ms. Tripp, who in turn might have told Mr. Isikoff. Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged that she had done so. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""[H]e was concerned about Linda, and I reassured him. He asked me if I trusted her, and I said yes."" (533) The President asked Ms. Lewinsky to try to persuade Ms. Tripp to call Mr. Lindsey. (534) The President, according to Ms. Lewinsky, also asked if she had confided anything about their relationship to Ms. Tripp. Ms. Lewinsky said (falsely) that she had not. (535) The President left to participate in a conference call, which Ms. Lewinsky understood was with his attorneys, while Ms. Lewinsky sat with Ms. Currie. (536) According to White House records, at 10:03 p.m. the President participated in a 51-minute conference call with Robert Bennett, his private attorney in the Jones case, and Charles Ruff, White House Counsel. Immediately after completing that call, the President had a six-minute phone conversation with Bruce Lindsey. (537) Afterward, the President returned and told Ms. Lewinsky, in her recollection, to notify Ms. Currie the following day, ""without getting into details with her, even mentioning names with her,"" whether Ms. Lewinsky had ""'mission-accomplished' . . . with Linda."" (538) The next day, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she did talk with Ms. Tripp, then called Ms. Currie and said she needed to talk with the President. He called her that evening. She told him ""that I had tried to talk to Linda and that she didn't seem very receptive to trying to get in touch with Bruce Lindsey again, but that I would continue to try."" (539) The President was in a sour mood, according to Ms. Lewinsky, and their conversation was brief. (540) E. July 16 Meeting with Marsha Scott On July 16, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky met again with Ms. Scott about returning to the White House. (541) Ms. Scott said she would try to detail Ms. Lewinsky from the Pentagon to Ms. Scott's office on a temporary basis, according to Ms. Lewinsky. (542) In that way, Ms. Scott said, Ms. Lewinsky could prove herself. Ms. Scott also said that ""they had to be careful and protect [the President]."" (543) Both Ms. Scott and Ms. Currie confirmed that Ms. Scott talked with Ms. Lewinsky about the possibility of being detailed to work at the White House. (544) Ms. Scott testified that she tried to arrange the detail on her own, without any direction from the President; Ms. Currie, however, testified that the President instructed her and Ms. Scott to try to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. (545) F. July 24 Meeting On Thursday, July 24, 1997, the day after her 24th birthday, Ms. Lewinsky visited the White House from 6:04 to 6:26 p.m., admitted by Ms. Currie. (546) The President was in the Oval Office when she arrived; he moved to the study at 6:14 p.m. and remained there until her departure. (547) He had no telephone calls during Ms. Lewinsky's visit. (548) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she went to the White House to pick up a photograph from Ms. Currie, who said the President might be available for a quick meeting. Ms. Currie put Ms. Lewinsky in the Cabinet Room while the President finished another meeting, then took her to see him. They chatted for five to ten minutes, and the President gave Ms. Lewinsky, as a birthday present, an antique pin. (549) G. Newsweek Article and Its Aftermath Newsweek published the Kathleen Willey story in its August 11, 1997, edition (which appeared a week before the cover date). The article quoted Ms. Tripp as saying that Ms. Willey, after leaving the Oval Office on the day of the President's alleged advances, looked ""disheveled,"" ""flustered, happy, and joyful."" The article also quoted Robert Bennett as saying that Ms. Tripp was ""not to be believed."" (550) After the article appeared, Ms. Tripp wrote a letter to Newsweek charging that she had been misquoted, but the magazine did not publish it. (551) Ms. Lewinsky subsequently told the President about Ms. Tripp's letter. He replied, Ms. Lewinsky said in a recorded conversation, ""Well, that's good because it sure seemed like she screwed me from that article."" (552) H. August 16 Meeting On Saturday, August 16, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky tried, unsuccessfully, to resume her sexual relationship with the President. She visited the White House on that day from 9:02 to 10:20 a.m. (553) The President moved from the Residence to the Oval Office at 9:20 a.m. and remained in the Oval Office until 10:03 a.m. (554) After a one-minute call to Betty Currie at her desk at 9:18 a.m., evidently from the Residence, the President had no calls while Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House. (555) The next day he left for a vacation on Martha's Vineyard. (556) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she brought birthday gifts for the President (his birthday is August 19): I had set up in his back office, I had brought an apple square and put a candle and had put his birthday presents out. And after he came back in and I sang happy birthday and he got his presents, I asked him . . . if we could share a birthday kiss in honor of our birthdays, because mine had been just a few weeks before. So, he said that that was okay and we could kind of bend the rules that day. And so . . . we kissed. (557) Ms. Lewinsky touched the President's genitals through his pants and moved to perform oral sex, but the President rebuffed her. (558) In her recollection: ""[H]e said, I'm trying not to do this and I'm trying to be good. . . . [H]e got visibly upset. And so . . . I hugged him and I told him I was sorry and not to be upset."" (559) Later, in a draft note to ""Handsome,"" Ms. Lewinsky referred to this visit: ""It was awful when I saw you for your birthday in August. You were so distant that I missed you as I was holding you in my arms."" (560) I. Continuing Job Efforts Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Scott talked by phone on September 3, 1997, for 47 minutes. (561) According to notes that Ms. Lewinsky wrote to two friends, Ms. Scott told her that the detail slot in her office had been eliminated. (562) Ms. Lewinsky told one friend: So for now, there isn't any place for me to be detailed. So I should be PATIENT. I told her I was very upset and disappointed (even though I really didn't want to work for her) and then she and I got into it. She didn't understand why I wanted to come back when there were still people there who would give me a hard time and that it isn't the right political climate for me to come back. . . . She asked me why I kept pushing the envelope on coming back there -- after all, I had the experience of being there already. So it's over. I don't know what I will do now but I can't wait any more and I can't go through all of this crap anymore. In some ways I hope I never hear from him again because he'll just lead me on because he doesn't have the balls to tell me the truth. (563) Ms. Scott testified that ""[t]he gist"" of Ms. Lewinsky's email message describing the conversation ""fits with what I remember telling her."" (564) Ms. Lewinsky expressed her escalating frustration in a note to the President that she drafted (but did not send). (565) She wrote: I believe the time has finally come for me to throw in the towel. My conversation with Marsha left me disappointed, frustrated, sad and angry. I can't help but wonder if you knew she wouldn't be able to detail me over there when I last saw you. Maybe that would explain your coldness. The only explanation I can reason for your not bringing me back is that you just plain didn't want to enough or care about me enough. Ms. Lewinsky went on to discuss other women rumored to be involved with the President who enjoy ""golden positions,"" above criticism, ""because they have your approval."" She continued: ""I just loved you -- wanted to spend time with you, kiss you, listen to you laugh -- and I wanted you to love me back."" She closed: ""As I said in my last letter to you I've waited long enough. You and Marsha win. I give up. You let me down, but I shouldn't have trusted you in the first place. (566) Ms. Lewinsky continued trying to discuss her situation with the President. On Friday, September 12, 1997, she arrived at the White House without an appointment, called Ms. Currie, and had a long wait at the gate. When Ms. Currie came to meet her, Ms. Lewinsky was crying. Ms. Currie explained that sometimes the President's hands are tied -- but, she said, she had gotten his authorization to ask John Podesta, the Deputy Chief of Staff, to help Ms. Lewinsky return to work at the White House. (567) J. Black Dog Gifts Before the President had left for vacation, Ms. Lewinsky had sent a note asking if he could bring her a T-shirt from the Black Dog, a popular Vineyard restaurant. (568) In early September, Ms. Currie gave several Black Dog items to Ms. Lewinsky. (569) In an email message to Catherine Davis, Ms. Lewinsky wrote: ""Well, I found out from Betty yesterday that he not only brought me a t-shirt, he got me 2 t-shirts, a hat and a dress!!!! Even though he's a big schmuck, that is surprisingly sweet -- even that he remembered!"" (570) K. Lucy Mercer Letter and Involvement of Chief of Staff A letter dated September 30, 1997, styled as an official memo, was found in Ms. Lewinsky's apartment. According to Ms. Lewinsky, she sent this letter or a similar one to the President. (572) Addressed to ""Handsome"" and bearing the subject line ""The New Deal,"" the faux memo proposed a visit that evening after ""everyone else goes home."" Ms. Lewinsky wrote: ""You will show me that you will let me visit you sans a crisis, and I will be on my best behavior and not stressed out when I come (to see you, that is)."" She closed with an allusion to a woman rumored to have been involved with an earlier President: ""Oh, and Handsome, remember FDR would never have turned down a visit with Lucy Mercer!"" (573) Ms. Lewinsky did not visit the White House the night of September 30, but the President called her late the night of September 30 or October 1. (574) According to Ms. Lewinsky, he may have mentioned during this call that he would get Erskine Bowles to help her find a White House job. (575) At around this time, the President did ask the White House Chief of Staff to help in the job search. Mr. Bowles testified about a conversation with the President in the Oval Office: ""He told me that there was a young woman -- her name was Monica Lewinsky -- who used to work at the White House; that Evelyn . . . thought she hung around the Oval Office too much and transferred her to the Pentagon."" (576) The President asked Mr. Bowles to try to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in the Old Executive Office Building. (577) Mr. Bowles assigned his deputy, John Podesta, to handle it. (578) L. News of Job Search Failure On October 6, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she was told that she would never work at the White House again. Ms. Tripp conveyed the news, which she indicated had come from a friend on the White House staff. Ms. Lewinsky testified: Linda Tripp called me at work on October 6th and told me that her friend Kate in the NSC . . . had heard rumors about me and that I would never work in the White House again . . . . [Kate's] advice to me was ""get out of town."" (579) For Ms. Lewinsky, who had previously considered moving to New York, this call was the ""straw that broke the camel's back."" (580) She was enraged. (581) In a note she drafted (but did not send), Ms. Lewinsky expressed her frustration. She wrote: Any normal person would have walked away from this and said, ""He doesn't call me, he doesn't want to see me -- screw it. It doesn't matter."" I can't let go of you. . . . I want to be a source of pleasure and laughter and energy to you. I want to make you smile. She went on to relate that she had heard second-hand from a White House employee ""that I was 'after the President' and would never be allowed to work [in] the complex."" Ms. Lewinsky said she could only conclude ""that all you have promised me is an empty promise. . . . I am once again totally humiliated. It is very clear that there is no way I am going to be brought back."" She closed the note: ""I will never do anything to hurt you. I am simply not that kind of person. Moreover, I love you."" (582) When terminating their sexual relationship on May 24, the President had told Ms. Lewinsky that he hoped they would remain friends, for he could do a great deal for her. (583) Now, having learned that he could not (or would not) get her a White House job, Ms. Lewinsky decided to ask him for a job in New York, perhaps at the United Nations -- a possibility that she had mentioned to him in passing over the summer. On the afternoon of October 6, Ms. Lewinsky spoke of this plan to Ms. Currie, who quoted the President as having said earlier: ""Oh, that's no problem. We can place her in the UN like that."" (584) In a recorded conversation later on October 6, Ms. Lewinsky said she wanted two things from the President. The first was contrition: He needed to ""acknowledge . . . that he helped fuck up my life."" (585) The second was a job, one that she could obtain without much effort: ""I don't want to have to work for this position . . . . I just want it to be given to me."" (586) Ms. Lewinsky decided to write the President a note proposing that the two of them ""get together and work on some way that I can come out of this situation not feeling the way I do."" (587) After composing the letter, she said: ""I want him to feel a little guilty, and I hope that this letter did that."" (588) In this letter, which was sent via courier on October 7, Ms. Lewinsky said she understood that she would never be given a White House job, and she asked for a prompt meeting to discuss her job situation. (589) She went on to advance a specific request: I'd like to ask you to help me secure a position in NY beginning 1 December. I would be very grateful, and I am hoping this is a solution for both of us. I want you to know that it has always been and remains more important to me to have you in my life than to come back. . . . Please don't let me down. (590) IX. October-November 1997: United Nations' Job Offer Having learned that she would not be able to return to the White House, Ms. Lewinsky sought the President's help in finding a job in New York City. The President offered to place her at the United Nations. After initial enthusiasm, Ms. Lewinsky cooled on the idea of working at the U.N., and she prodded the President to get her a job in the private sector. A. October 10: Telephone Conversation According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at approximately 2:00 to 2:30 a.m. on Friday, October 10. (591) They spent much of the hour-and-a-half call arguing. ""[H]e got so mad at me, he must have been purple,"" she later recalled. (592) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said: ""If I had known what kind of person you really were, I wouldn't have gotten involved with you."" (593) He reminded Ms. Lewinsky that she had earlier promised, ""[i]f you just want to stop doing this, I'll . . . be no trouble."" (594) Ms. Lewinsky said she challenged the President: ""[T]ell me . . . when I've caused you trouble."" (595) The President responded, ""I've never worried about you. I've never been worried you would do something to hurt me."" (596) When the conversation shifted to her job search, Ms. Lewinsky complained that the President had not done enough to help her. He responded that, on the contrary, he was eager to help. (597) The President said that he regretted Ms. Lewinsky's transfer to the Pentagon and assured her that he would not have permitted it had he foreseen the difficulty in returning her to the White House. (598) Ms. Lewinsky told him that she wanted a job in New York by the end of October, and the President promised to do what he could. (599) B. October 11 Meeting At approximately 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, October 11, according to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie called and told her that the President wished to see her. (600) Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 9:36 a.m. and departed at 10:54 a.m. (601) The President entered the Oval Office at 9:52 a.m. (602) Ms. Lewinsky met with the President in the study, and they discussed her job search. (603) Ms. Lewinsky told the President that she wanted to pursue jobs in the private sector, and he told her to prepare a list of New York companies that interested her. (604) Ms. Lewinsky asked the President whether Vernon Jordan, a well-known Washington attorney who she knew was a close friend of the President and had many business contacts, might help her find a job. (605) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was receptive to the idea. (606) In a recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky said that, at the end of the October 11 meeting, she and the President joined Ms. Currie in the Oval Office. The President grabbed Ms. Lewinsky's arm and kissed her on the forehead. (607) He told her: ""I talked to Erskine [Bowles] about . . . trying to get John Hilley to give you . . . a good recommendation for your work here."" (608) Later, Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp discussed their concerns about the President's involvement in Ms. Lewinsky's job search. Specifically, Ms. Lewinsky was nervous about involving the President's Chief of Staff: Ms. Lewinsky: Well, see, I don't really think -- I'm going to tell him that I don't think Erskine should have anything to do with this. I don't think anybody who works there should. Ms. Tripp: I don't see how that's -- how that's a problem. Ms. Lewinsky: Because look at what happened with Webb Hubbell. (609) Ms. Lewinsky preferred that Vernon Jordan assist her in her job search: Ms. Tripp: Well, I don't remember during the Webb Hubbell thing, was Vernon mentioned? Ms. Lewinsky: Yeah, but there's a big difference. I think somebody could construe, okay? Somebody could construe or say, ""Well, they gave her a job to shut her up. They made her happy. . . . And he [Mr. Bowles] works for the government and shouldn't have done that."" And with the other one [Mr. Jordan] you can't say that. (610) C. October 16-17: The ""Wish List "" On October 16, Ms. Lewinsky sent the President a packet, which included what she called a ""wish list"" describing the types of jobs that interested her in New York City. (611) The note began: My dream had been to work in Communications or Strategic Planning at the White House. I am open to any suggestions that you may have on work that is similar to that or may intrigue me. The most important things to me are that I am engaged and interested in my work, I am not someone's administrative/ executive assistant, and my salary can provide me a comfortable living in NY. (612) She identified five public relations firms where she would like to work. (613) Ms. Lewinsky concluded by saying of the United Nations: I do not have any interest in working there. As a result of what happened in April '96, I have already spent a year and a half at an agency in which I have no interest. I want a job where I feel challenged, engaged, and interested. I don't think the UN is the right place for me. (614) In a recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky said she wanted the President to take her list seriously and not ask her to settle for a U.N. job. (615) She said she hoped ""that if he starts to pick a bone with me and the U.N., he sure as hell doesn't do it on the phone. . . . I don't want to start getting into a screaming match with him on the phone."" (616) In addition to the ""wish list,"" Ms. Lewinsky said she enclosed in the packet a pair of sunglasses and ""a lot of things in a little envelope,"" including some jokes, a card, and a postcard. (617) She said that she had written on the card: ""Wasn't I right that my hugs are better in person than in cards?"" (618) The postcard featured a ""very erotic"" Egon Schiele painting. (619) Ms. Lewinsky also enclosed a note with her thoughts on education reform. (620) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she felt that the President owed her a job for several reasons: Her relationship with him was the reason she had been transferred out of the White House; he had promised her a job and so far had done nothing to help her find one; and she had left the White House ""quietly,"" without making an issue of her relationship with the President. (623) D. The President Creates Options At some point around this time in the fall of 1997, Ms. Currie asked John Podesta, the Deputy Chief of Staff, to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New York. (624) Mr. Podesta testified that, during a Presidential trip to Latin America, he approached then-U.N. Ambassador William Richardson while aboard Air Force One and asked the Ambassador to consider a former White House intern for a position at the U.N. (626) At the time, Mr. Podesta could not recall the intern's name. (627) Ambassador Richardson and the President both testified that they never discussed Ms. Lewinsky with each other. (628) Ambassador Richardson returned from Latin America on Sunday, October 19. (629) Within a few days, his Executive Assistant, Isabelle Watkins, called Mr. Podesta's secretary and asked whether ""she knew anything about a resume that John was going to send us."" (630) Mr. Podesta's secretary knew nothing about it and asked Mr. Podesta what to do; he instructed her to call Ms. Currie. (631) At 3:09 p.m. on October 21, Ms. Currie faxed Ms. Lewinsky's resume to the United Nations. (632) At 7:01 p.m., a six-minute call was placed to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment from a U.N. telephone number identified in State Department records as ""Ambassador Richardson's line."" (633) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she spoke to Ambassador Richardson. A woman called, Ms. Lewinsky testified, and said, ""[H]old for Ambassador Richardson."" (634) Then the Ambassador himself came on the line: ""I remember, because I was shocked and I was . . . very nervous."" (635) The purpose of the call was to schedule a job interview at a Watergate apartment the following week. (636) At odds with Ms. Lewinsky, the Ambassador and Ms. Watkins both testified that Ms. Watkins, not the Ambassador, spoke with Ms. Lewinsky. (637) A few days later, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President called her. She had been upset because no one at the White House had prepared her for the Ambassador's recent call and because she did not want the White House to railroad her into taking the U.N. job. (638) She reiterated that she was eager to pursue other opportunities, especially in the private sector. (639) The President reassured her, promising that a U.N. position was just one of many options. (640) Ms. Lewinsky spoke to the President again one week later. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told Ms. Currie to ask the President to call her to assuage her nervousness before the U.N. interview. (641) According to Ms. Lewinsky, on October 30, the night before the interview, the President did call. She characterized the conversation as a ""pep talk"": ""[H]e was trying to kind of build my confidence and reassure me."" (642) The President told her to call Ms. Currie after the interview. (644) In his Jones deposition, the President indicated that he learned of her interview with Ambassador Richardson not from Ms. Lewinsky herself but from Ms. Currie. (645) E. The U.N. Interview and Job Offer On Friday morning, October 31, Ambassador Richardson and two of his assistants, Mona Sutphen and Rebecca Cooper, interviewed Ms. Lewinsky at the Watergate. (646) According to Ambassador Richardson, he ""listen[ed] while Mona and Rebecca were interviewing her."" (647) Neither Ambassador Richardson nor any of his staff made inquiries, before or after the interview, about Ms. Lewinsky's prior work performance. (648) On Sunday, November 2, Ms. Lewinsky drafted a letter to Ms. Currie asking what to do in the event she received an offer from the U.N. (649) She wrote: I became a bit nervous this weekend when I realized that Amb. Richardson said his staff would be in touch with me this week . As you know, the UN is supposed to be my back-up, but because VJ [Vernon Jordan] has been out of town, this is my only option right now. What should I say to Richardson's people this week when they call? (650) Ms. Lewinsky asked Ms. Currie to speak to the President about her problem: ""If you feel it's appropriate, maybe you could ask 'the big guy' what he wants me to do. Ahhhhh . . . anxiety!!!!!"" (651) Ms. Lewinsky also mentioned the President's promise to involve Vernon Jordan in her job search: I don't think I told you that in my conversation last Thursday night with him that he said that he would ask you to set up a meeting between VJ and myself, once VJ got back. I assume he'll mention this to you at some point -- hopefully sooner rather than later! (652) Before Ms. Lewinsky sent this letter, in her recollection, she received an offer from the U.N. (653) Phone records reflect that, at 11:02 a.m. on November 3, a three-minute call was placed to Ms. Lewinsky from the U.N. line identified in State Department records as Ambassador Richardson's. (654) Ms. Lewinsky stated that she believes she spoke to Ambassador Richardson, who extended her a job offer. (655) According to his assistant, Ambassador Richardson made the decision to hire Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Sutphen testified: I said, are you sure; and he said, yeah, yeah, I'm sure, why. And I said . . . are you sure, though you don't want to talk to anyone else . . . . And he said, no, no, I think it's fine; why don't you go ahead and give her an offer? (656) Ambassador Richardson and Ms. Sutphen both testified that Ms. Sutphen, not the Ambassador, extended the job offer to Ms. Lewinsky. They recalled that the offer was made a week or 10 days after the interview, though Ms. Sutphen, when shown the phone records, testified that the November 3 call to Ms. Lewinsky probably was the job offer. (657) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told Ms. Currie about the offer and she probably also told the President directly. (658) Ms. Currie first testified that she had ""probably"" told the President about Ms. Lewinsky's U.N. offer, then testified that she had in fact told him, then testified that she could not remember, though she acknowledged that the President was interested in Ms. Lewinsky's getting a job. (659) When the President was asked in the Jones deposition whether he knew that Ms. Lewinsky had received the offer of a job at the U.N., he testified: ""I know that she interviewed for one. I don't know if she was offered one or not."" (660) F. The U.N. Job Offer Declined Three weeks after she received an offer, on November 24, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Sutphen and asked for more time to consider the offer because she wanted to pursue possibilities in the private sector. (661) Ms. Sutphen told Ambassador Richardson, who, according to Ms. Sutphen, said the delay would be fine. (662) Over a month later, on January 5, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky finally turned down the job. (663) X. November 1997: Growing Frustration Ms. Lewinsky met with Vernon Jordan, who promised to help her find a job in New York. November proved, however, to be a month of inactivity with respect to both Ms. Lewinsky's job search and her relationship with the President. Mr. Jordan did not meet with Ms. Lewinsky again, nor did he contact anyone in New York City on her behalf. Ms. Lewinsky became increasingly anxious about her inability to see the President. Except for a momentary encounter in mid-November, Ms. Lewinsky did not meet with the President between October 11 and December 5. A. Interrogatories Answered On November 3, 1997, the President answered Paula Jones's Second Set of Interrogatories. Two of those interrogatories asked the President to list any woman other than his wife with whom he had ""had,"" ""proposed having,"" or ""sought to have"" sexual relations during the time that he was Attorney General of Arkansas, Governor of Arkansas, and President of the United States. (664) President Clinton objected to the scope and relevance of both interrogatories and refused to answer them. (665) B. First Vernon Jordan Meeting In mid-October, the President had agreed to involve Vernon Jordan in Ms. Lewinsky's job search. (666) In a draft letter to Ms. Currie dated November 2, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that the President had ""said he would ask you to set up a meeting between VJ and myself."" (667) According to Ms. Lewinsky, on November 3 or November 4, Ms. Currie told her to call Vernon Jordan's secretary to arrange a meeting. (668) Ms. Currie said she had spoken with Mr. Jordan and he was expecting Ms. Lewinsky's call. (669) In Ms. Lewinsky's account, Ms. Currie sought Mr. Jordan's aid at the President's direction. (670) Mr. Jordan likewise testified that, in his understanding, the President was behind Ms. Currie's request. (671) Ms. Currie testified at various points that she contacted Mr. Jordan on her own initiative; that the President ""probably"" talked with her about Ms. Lewinsky's New York job hunt; and that she could not recall whether the President was involved. (672) In his Jones deposition, the President was asked whether he did anything to facilitate a meeting between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky. He testified: I can tell you what my memory is. My memory is that Vernon said something to me about her coming in, Betty had called and asked if he [Mr. Jordan] would see her [Ms. Lewinsky]. . . . I'm sure if he said something to me about it I said something positive about it. I wouldn't have said anything negative about it. (673) When pressed, the President testified that he did not think that he was the ""precipitating force"" in arranging the meeting between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky. (674) At 8:50 a.m. on November 5, Mr. Jordan spoke with the President by telephone for five minutes. (675) Later that morning, Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky met in his office for about twenty minutes. (676) She told him that she intended to move to New York, and she named several companies where she hoped to work. (677) She showed him the ""wish list"" that she had sent the President on October 16. (678) Mr. Jordan said that he had spoken with the President about her and that she came ""highly recommended."" (679) Concerning her job search, Mr. Jordan said: ""We're in business."" (681) In the course of the day, Mr. Jordan placed four calls to Ms. Hernreich (whom he acknowledged calling when he wished to speak to the President (682) ) and one to Ms. Currie. (683) Mr. Jordan testified that he could not remember the calls, but ""[i]t is entirely possible"" that they concerned Monica Lewinsky. (684) Mr. Jordan also visited the White House and met with the President at 2:00 p.m. that day. (685) Again, Mr. Jordan testified that he had ""no recollection"" of the substance of his conversation with the President. (686) On November 6, the day after meeting with Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky wrote him a thank-you letter: ""It made me happy to know that our friend has such a wonderful confidant in you."" (687) Also on November 6, Ms. Lewinsky wrote in an email to a friend that she expected to hear from Mr. Jordan ""later next week."" (688) The evidence indicates, though, that Mr. Jordan took no steps to help Ms. Lewinsky until early December, after she appeared on the witness list in the Jones case. Mr. Jordan initially testified that he had ""no recollection of having met with Ms. Lewinsky on November 5."" (689) When shown documentary evidence demonstrating that his first meeting with Ms. Lewinsky occurred in early November, he acknowledged that an early November meeting was ""entirely possible."" (690) Mr. Jordan's failure to remember his November meeting with Ms. Lewinsky may indicate the low priority he attached to it at the time. C. November 13: The Zedillo Visit On Thursday, November 13, while Ernesto Zedillo, the President of Mexico, was in the White House, Ms. Lewinsky met very briefly with President Clinton in the private study. (691) Ms. Lewinsky's visit, which she described in an email as a ""hysterical escapade,"" was the culmination of days of phone calls and notes to Ms. Currie and the President. (692) Over the course of the week that preceded November 13, Ms. Lewinsky made several attempts to arrange a visit with the President. On Monday, November 10, in addition to making frequent calls to Ms. Currie, she sent the President a note asking for a meeting. (693) She hoped to see him on Tuesday, November 11 (Veterans Day), but he did not respond. (694) By courier, (695) she sent the President another note: I asked you three weeks ago to please be sensitive to what I am going through right now and to keep in contact with me, and yet I'm still left writing notes in vain. I am not a moron. I know that what is going on in the world takes precedence, but I don't think what I have asked you for is unreasonable. (696) She added: ""This is so hard for me. I am trying to deal with so much emotionally, and I have nobody to talk to about it. I need you right now not as president, but as a man. PLEASE be my friend."" (697) That evening, November 12, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President called and invited her to the White House the following day. (698) In an email to a friend, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that she and the President ""talked for almost an hour."" (699) She added: ""[H]e thought [N]ancy [Hernreich] (one of the meanies) would be out for a few hours on Thursday and I could come see him then."" (700) The following morning, November 13, Ms. Lewinsky tried to arrange a visit with the President. She called repeatedly but suspected that Ms. Currie was not telling the President of her calls. (701) Around noon, Ms. Currie told Ms. Lewinsky that the President had left to play golf. Ms. Lewinsky, in her own words, ""went ballistic."" (702) After the President returned from the Army-Navy Golf Course in the late afternoon, Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Currie that she was coming to the White House to give him some gifts. (703) Ms. Currie suggested that Ms. Lewinsky wait in Ms. Currie's car in the White House parking lot. Ms. Lewinsky went to the White House only to find that the doors to Ms. Currie's car were locked. Ms. Lewinsky waited in the rain. (704) Ms. Currie eventually met her in the parking lot, and, in Ms. Lewinsky's words, they made a ""bee-line"" into the White House, sneaking up the back stairs to avoid other White House employees, particularly Presidential aide Stephen Goodin. (705) Ms. Lewinsky left two small gifts for the President with Ms. Currie, then waited alone for about half an hour in the Oval Office study. (706) In the study, Ms. Lewinsky saw several gifts she had given the President, including Oy Vey! The Things They Say: A Guide to Jewish Wit , Nicholson Baker's novel Vox , and a letter opener decorated with a frog. (707) The President finally joined Ms. Lewinsky in the study, where they were alone for only a minute or two. (708) Ms. Lewinsky gave him an antique paperweight in the shape of the White House. (709) She also showed him an email describing the effect of chewing Altoid mints before performing oral sex. Ms. Lewinsky was chewing Altoids at the time, but the President replied that he did not have enough time for oral sex. (710) They kissed, and the President rushed off for a State Dinner with President Zedillo. (711) D. November 14-December 4: Inability to See the President After this brief November 13 meeting, Ms. Lewinsky did not see the President again until the first week in December. Hoping to arrange a longer rendezvous, she sent the President several notes, as well as a cassette on which she recorded a message. (712) Along with her chagrin over not seeing the President, Ms. Lewinsky was frustrated that her job search had apparently stalled. A few days before Thanksgiving, she complained to Ms. Currie that she had not heard from Mr. Jordan. (713) Ms. Currie arranged for her to speak with him ""before Thanksgiving,"" while Ms. Lewinsky was in Los Angeles. Mr. Jordan told her to call him the following week to arrange another meeting. (714) In draft letters to the President, which were recovered from her Pentagon computer, Ms. Lewinsky reflected on the change in their relationship: ""[B]oth professionally and personally, . . . our personal relationship changing has caused me more pain. Do you realize that?"" (715) She asked for the President's understanding: ""I don't want you to think that I am not grateful for what you are doing for me now -- I'd probably be in a mental institute without it -- but I am consumed with this disappointment, frustration, and anger."" Ms. Lewinsky rued the brevity of her November 13 visit with the President: ""All you . . . . ever have to do to pacify me is see me and hold me,"" she wrote. ""Maybe that's asking too much."" (716) XI. December 5-18, 1997: The Witness List and Job Search On Friday, December 5, Paula Jones's attorneys faxed a list of their potential witnesses -- including Ms. Lewinsky -- to the President's personal attorneys. The following day, President Clinton saw Ms. Lewinsky in an unscheduled visit and then discussed the Jones case with his attorneys and Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey. A few days later, Ms. Lewinsky met with Mr. Jordan at his office, and he arranged interviews for Ms. Lewinsky at three companies. In the middle of the night on December 17, the President called and informed Ms. Lewinsky that she was on the witness list and that she might have to testify under oath in the Jones case. A. December 5: The Witness List On Friday December 5, 1997, attorneys for Paula Jones identified Ms. Lewinsky as a potential witness in Ms. Jones's sexual harassment case. (717) At 5:40 p.m., they faxed their witness list to the President's attorney, Robert Bennett. (718) Ms. Lewinsky, however, would not learn of her potential involvement in the Jones case for twelve more days, when the President informed her. (719) President Clinton was asked in the grand jury when he learned that Ms. Lewinsky's name was on the witness list. The President responded: ""I believe that I found out late in the afternoon on the sixth."" (720) B. December 5: Christmas Party at the White House On Friday, December 5, Ms. Lewinsky returned from Department of Defense travel in Europe. (721) She asked Ms. Currie if the President could see her the next day, but Ms. Currie said he was busy meeting with his lawyers. (722) In the late afternoon, she attended a Christmas party at the White House with a Defense Department colleague. (723) Ms. Lewinsky exchanged a few words with the President in the reception line. (724) The Christmas reception encounter heightened Ms. Lewinsky's frustration. On the evening of December 5, she drafted an anguished letter to the President. (725) ""[Y]ou want me out of your life,"" she wrote. ""I guess the signs have been made clear for awhile -- not wanting to see me and rarely calling. I used to think it was you putting up walls."" (727) She had purchased several gifts for him, and, she wrote, ""I wanted to give them to you in person, but that is obviously not going to happen."" (728) Ms. Lewinsky reminded the President of his words during their October 10 telephone argument: I will never forget what you said that night we fought on the phone -- if you had known what I was really like you would never have gotten involved with me. I'm sure you're not the first person to have felt that way about me. I am sorry that this has been such a bad experience. (729) She concluded the letter: ""I knew it would hurt to say goodbye to you; I just never thought it would have to be on paper. Take care."" (730) C. December 6: The Northwest Gate Incident 1. Initial Visit and Rejection On the morning of Saturday, December 6, Ms. Lewinsky went to the White House to deliver the letter and gifts to the President. The gifts included a sterling silver antique cigar holder, a tie, a mug, a ""Hugs and Kisses"" box, and an antique book about Theodore Roosevelt. (731) Ms. Lewinsky planned to leave the parcel with Ms. Currie, who had told Ms. Lewinsky that the President would be busy with his lawyers and unable to see her. (732) Ms. Lewinsky arrived at the White House at approximately 10:00 a.m. She told the Secret Service uniformed officers at the Northwest Gate that she had gifts to drop off for the President, but that Ms. Currie did not know she was coming. (733) Ms. Lewinsky and the officers made several calls in an attempt to locate Ms. Currie. (734) The officers eventually invited Ms. Lewinsky inside the guard booth. (735) When Ms. Currie learned that Ms. Lewinsky was at the Northwest Gate, she sent word that the President ""already had a guest in the [O]val,"" so the officers should have Ms. Lewinsky wait there for about 40 minutes. (736) While Ms. Lewinsky was waiting, one officer mentioned that Eleanor Mondale was in the White House. (737) Ms. Lewinsky correctly surmised that the President was meeting with Ms. Mondale, rather than his lawyers, and she was ""livid."" (738) She stormed away, called and berated Ms. Currie from a pay phone, and then returned to her Watergate apartment. (740) Hands shaking and almost crying, Ms. Currie informed several Secret Service officers that the President was ""irate"" that someone had disclosed to Ms. Lewinsky whom he was meeting with. (741) Ms. Currie told Sergeant Keith Williams, a supervisory uniformed Secret Service Officer, that if he ""didn't find out what was going on, someone could be fired."" (742) She also told Captain Jeffrey Purdie, the Secret Service watch commander for the uniformed division at the time, that the President was ""so upset he wants somebody fired over this."" (743) 2. Ms. Lewinsky Returns to the White House From her apartment, Ms. Lewinsky reached the President on the phone. (745) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was angry that she had ""made a stink"" and said that ""it was none of my business . . . what he was doing."" (746) Then, to Ms. Lewinsky's surprise, the President invited her to visit him. (747) She testified that ""none of the other times that we had really fought on the phone did it end up resulting in a visit that day."" (748) WAVES records reflect that Ms. Lewinsky was cleared to enter the White House at 12:52 p.m. and exited at 1:36 p.m. (749) During their meeting, Ms. Lewinsky told the President that Mr. Jordan had done nothing to help her find a job. (750) The President responded, ""Oh, I'll talk to him. I'll get on it."" (751) Ms. Lewinsky testified that, overall, she had a ""really nice"" and ""affectionate"" visit with the President. (752) In an email to a friend a few days later, she wrote that, although ""things have been crazy with the creep, . . . I did have a wonderful visit with him on Saturday. When he doesn't put his walls up, it is always heavenly."" (753) 3. ""Whatever Just Happened Didn't Happen"" Later that day (December 6), the uniformed Secret Service officers at the Northwest Gate were told that no one would be fired -- so long as they remained quiet. According to Sergeant Williams, Ms. Currie said that, if the officers did not ""tell a lot of people what had happened, then nothing would happen."" (754) The President told Captain Jeffrey Purdie, the Secret Service watch commander for the uniformed division at the time, ""I hope you use your discretion."" (755) Captain Purdie interpreted the President's remark to mean that Captain Purdie ""wasn't going to say anything,"" and he in turn told all of the officers involved not to discuss the incident. (756) One officer recalled that Captain Purdie told him and other officers, ""Whatever just happened didn't happen."" (757) Captain Purdie told another officer, ""I was just in the Oval Office with the President and he wants somebody's ass out here. . . . As far as you're concerned, . . . [t]his never happened."" (758) In response, that officer, who considered the Northwest Gate incident a ""major event,"" ""just shook [his] head"" and ""started making a set of [his] own notes"" in order to document the incident. (759) Captain Purdie recommended to his supervisor, Deputy Chief Charles O'Malley, that ""no paperwork be generated"" regarding the Northwest Gate incident because ""Ms. Currie was satisfied with the way things were handled."" (760) According to Captain Purdie, Deputy Chief O'Malley agreed, and no record of the incident was made. (761) Deputy Chief O'Malley testified that the meeting between the President and Captain Purdie was the only occasion he could recall in fourteen years at the White House where a President directly addressed a job performance issue with a uniformed division supervisor. (762) The President was questioned in the grand jury about the incident at the Northwest Gate. He testified that he knew that Ms. Lewinsky had become upset upon learning that Ms. Mondale was in the White House ""to see us that day."" (763) He testified: ""As I remember, I had some other work to do that morning. . . . "" (764) The President said that the disclosure of information that day was ""inappropriate"" and ""a mistake,"" but he could not recall whether he wanted a Secret Service officer fired or gave any such orders. (765) He thought that the officers ""were . . . told not to let it happen again, and I think that's the way it should have been handled."" (766) When asked if he told Captain Purdie that he hoped that he could count on his discretion, the President stated, ""I don't remember anything I said to him in that regard."" (767) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President later indicated to her that he had concerns about the discretion of the Secret Service uniformed officers. On December 28 she asked how Paula Jones's attorneys could have known enough to place her on the witness list. The President replied that the source might be Linda Tripp or ""the uniformed officers."" (768) D. The President Confers with His Lawyers Deputy Counsel Bruce Lindsey testified that he met with the President and the President's personal attorney, Robert Bennett, at around 5:00 p.m. on December 6 to discuss the Jones case. (769) According to Mr. Lindsey, it was ""likely"" that he learned about Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the witness list in that meeting. (770) Earlier in the day, at around 12:00 p.m. (after Ms. Lewinsky stormed away from the Northwest Gate but before she returned and saw the President), Mr. Lindsey had received a page: ""Call Betty ASAP."" (771) Mr. Lindsey testified that he did not recall the page, nor did he know, at the time, that Ms. Lewinsky had visited the White House. (772) E. Second Jordan Meeting The next day (Sunday, December 7), Mr. Jordan visited the White House and met with the President. (774) Mr. Jordan testified that he was ""fairly certain"" that he did not discuss the Jones suit or Ms. Lewinsky. (775) On Thursday, December 11, Ms. Lewinsky had her second meeting with Mr. Jordan. (776) Ms. Lewinsky testified that they discussed her job search, and Mr. Jordan told her to send letters to three business contacts that he provided her. Mr. Jordan noted that Ms. Lewinsky was anxious to get a job as quickly as possible, and he took action. (777) In the course of the day, Mr. Jordan placed calls on her behalf to Peter Georgescu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Young & Rubicam; Richard Halperin, Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to the Chairman of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. (majority stockholder of Revlon); and Ursula Fairbairn, Executive Vice-President, Human Resources and Quality, of American Express. (778) Mr. Jordan told Ms. Lewinsky to keep him informed of the progress of her job search. (779) At one point in the conversation, according to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan said, ""[Y]ou're a friend of the President."" (780) This prompted Ms. Lewinsky to reveal that she ""didn't really look at him as the President""; rather, she ""reacted to him more as a man and got angry at him like a man and just a regular person."" (781) When Mr. Jordan asked why Ms. Lewinsky got angry at the President, she replied that she became upset ""when he doesn't call me enough or see me enough."" (782) Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mr. Jordan advised her to take her frustrations out on him rather than the President. (783) According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan summed up the situation: ""You're in love, that's what your problem is."" (785) Mr. Jordan recalled a similar conversation, in which Ms. Lewinsky complained that the President did not see her enough, although he thought it took place during a meeting eight days later. He testified that he felt the need to remind Ms. Lewinsky that the President is the ""leader of the free world"" and has competing obligations. (786) Mr. Jordan is ""certain"" that he had a conversation with the President about Ms. Lewinsky at some point after this December 11 meeting. (787) He told the President that he would be trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York. (788) Mr. Jordan testified that the President ""was aware that people were trying to get jobs for her, that Podesta was trying to help her, that Bill Richardson was trying to help her, but that she really wanted to work in the private sector."" (789) F. Early Morning Phone Call On December 15, 1997, Paula Jones's lawyers served President Clinton with her second set of document requests by overnight mail. These requests asked the President to ""produce documents that related to communications between the President and Monica Lewisky"" [sic]. (790) This was the first Paula Jones discovery request to refer to Monica Lewinsky by name. Ms. Lewinsky testified that in the early-morning hours of December 17, at roughly 2:00 or 2:30 a.m., she received a call from the President. (791) The call lasted about half an hour. (792) The President gave Ms. Lewinsky two items of news: Ms. Currie's brother had died in a car accident, and Ms. Lewinsky's name had appeared on the witness list in the Jones case. (793) According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said ""it broke his heart"" to see her name on the witness list. (794) The President told her that she would not necessarily be subpoenaed; if she were, he ""suggested she could sign an affidavit to try to satisfy [Ms. Jones's] inquiry and not be deposed."" (795) The President told Ms. Lewinsky to contact Ms. Currie in the event she were subpoenaed. (796) He also reviewed one of their established cover stories. He told Ms. Lewinsky that she ""should say she visited the [White House] to see Ms. Currie and, on occasion when working at the [White House], she brought him letters when no one else was around."" (797) The President's advice ""was . . . instantly familiar to [Ms. Lewinsky]."" (798) She testified that the President's use of this ""misleading"" story amounted to a continuation of their pre-existing pattern. (799) Later in the conversation, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said he would try to get Ms. Currie to come in over the weekend so that Ms. Lewinsky could visit and he could give her several Christmas presents. (800) Ms. Lewinsky replied that, since Ms. Currie's brother had just died, perhaps they should ""let Betty be."" (801) In his grand jury appearance, the President was questioned about the December 17 phone call. He testified that, although he could not rule it out, he did not remember such a call. (802) The President was also asked whether in this conversation, or a conversation before Ms. Lewinsky's name came up in the Jones case, he instructed her to say that she was coming to bring letters. The President answered: ""I might well have said that."" (803) But when asked whether he ever said anything along these lines after Ms. Lewinsky had been identified on the witness list, the President answered: ""I don't recall whether I might have done something like that."" (804) He speculated that he might have suggested this explanation in the context of a call from a reporter. (805) Nonetheless, he testified, in the context of the Jones case, ""I never asked her to lie."" (806) G. Job Interviews On December 18, Ms. Lewinsky had two job interviews in New York City. At MacAndrews & Forbes, she met with Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to the Chairman Richard Halperin, who viewed the interview as ""an accommodation for Vernon Jordan."" (807) At Burson-Marstellar, she interviewed with Celia Berk, Managing Director of Human Resources. (808) A few days later, on December 23, Ms. Lewinsky interviewed in Washington, D.C., with Thomas Schick, Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Communications, of American Express. (809) XII. December 19, 1997 - January 4, 1998: The Subpoena Ms. Lewinsky was served with a subpoena in the Jones case on Friday, December 19. She immediately called Mr. Jordan, and he invited her to his office. Mr. Jordan spoke with the President that afternoon and again that evening. He told the President that he had met with Ms. Lewinsky, that she had been subpoenaed, and that he planned to obtain an attorney for her. On Sunday, December 28, the President met with Ms. Lewinsky, who expressed concern about the subpoena's demand for the gifts he had given her. Later that day, Ms. Currie drove to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and collected a box containing some of the subpoenaed gifts. Ms. Currie took the box home and hid it under her bed. A. December 19: Ms. Lewinsky Is Subpoenaed On Friday, December 19, 1997, sometime between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., Ms. Lewinsky was served with a subpoena at her Pentagon office. (810) The subpoena commanded her to appear for a deposition in Washington, D.C., at 9:30 a.m. on January 23, 1998. (811) The subpoena also required the production of certain documents and gifts. Among the items that Ms. Lewinsky was required to produce were ""each and every gift including, but not limited to, any and all dresses, accessories, and jewelry, and/or hat pins given to you by, or on behalf of, Defendant Clinton,"" as well as ""[e]very document constituting or containing communications between you and Defendant Clinton, including letters, cards, notes, memoranda, and all telephone records."" (812) Ms. Lewinsky testified that, after being served with the subpoena, she ""burst into tears,"" and then telephoned Mr. Jordan from a pay phone at the Pentagon. (813) Mr. Jordan confirmed Ms. Lewinsky's account; he said he tried to reassure Ms. Lewinsky: ""[C]ome and talk to me and I will see what I can do about finding you counsel."" (814) According to records maintained by Mr. Jordan's law firm, Ms. Lewinsky arrived at his office at 4:47 p.m. (815) White House phone records show that, at 4:57 p.m., the President telephoned Mr. Jordan; the two men spoke from 5:01 p.m. to 5:05 p.m. (816) At 5:06 p.m., Mr. Jordan placed a two-minute call to a Washington, D.C., attorney named Francis Carter. (817) Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan gave somewhat different accounts of their meeting that day. According to Ms. Lewinsky, shortly after her arrival, Mr. Jordan received a phone call, and she stepped out of his office. A few minutes later, Ms. Lewinsky was invited back in, and Mr. Jordan called Mr. Carter. (819) Mr. Jordan testified that he spoke to the President before Ms. Lewinsky ever entered his office. (820) He told the President: ""Monica Lewinsky called me up. She's upset. She's gotten a subpoena. She is coming to see me about this subpoena. I'm confident that she needs a lawyer, and I will try to get her a lawyer."" (821) Mr. Jordan told the President that the lawyer he had in mind was Francis Carter. (822) According to Mr. Jordan, the President asked him: ""You think he's a good lawyer?"" Mr. Jordan responded that he was. (823) Mr. Jordan testified that informing the President of Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena ""was the purpose of [his] call."" (824) According to Mr. Jordan, when Ms. Lewinsky entered his office, ""[H]er emotional state was obviously one of dishevelment and she was quite upset. She was crying. She was -- she was highly emotional, to say the least."" (825) She showed him the subpoena as soon as she entered. (826) Ms. Lewinsky also testified that she discussed the subpoena with Mr. Jordan. (827) She told him that she found the specific reference to a hat pin alarming -- how could the Jones's attorneys have known about it? (828) Mr. Jordan told her it was ""a standard subpoena."" (829) When he indicated to Ms. Lewinsky that he would be seeing the President that night, Ms. Lewinsky told him ""to please make sure that he told the President"" about her subpoena. (830) At some point, according to Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky asked him about the future of the Clintons' marriage. (831) Because Ms. Lewinsky seemed ""mesmerized"" by President Clinton, (832) he ""asked her directly had there been any sexual relationship between [her] and the President."" (833) Mr. Jordan explained, ""You didn't have to be Einstein to know that that was a question that had to be asked by me at that particular time, because heretofore this discussion was about a job. The subpoena changed the circumstances."" (834) Ms. Lewinsky said she had not had a sexual relationship with the President. (835) Ms. Lewinsky testified, however, that at this time she assumed that Mr. Jordan knew ""with a wink and a nod that [she] was having a relationship with the President."" (836) She therefore interpreted Mr. Jordan's questions as ""What are you going to say?"" rather than ""What are the [actual] answers . . .?"" (837) When the meeting ended, she ""asked [Mr. Jordan] if he would give the President a hug."" (838) That evening, Mr. Jordan visited the President at the White House. According to Mr. Jordan, the two met alone in the Residence and talked for about ten minutes. (839) He testified: I told him that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed, came to me with a subpoena. I told him that I was concerned by her fascination, her being taken with him. I told him how emotional she was about having gotten the subpoena. I told him what she said to me about whether or not he was going to leave the First Lady at the end of the term. (840) Mr. Jordan asked the President ""[t]he one question that I wanted answered."" (841) That question was, ""Mr. President, have you had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky?"" The President told Mr. Jordan, ""No, never."" (842) Mr. Jordan told the President: ""I'm trying to help her get a job and I'm going to continue to do that. I'm going to get her counsel and I'm going to try to be helpful to her as much as I possibly can, both with the lawyer, and I've already done what I could about the job, and I think you ought to know that."" (843) Mr. Jordan testified: ""He thanked me for telling him. Thanked me for my efforts to get her a job and thanked me for getting her a lawyer."" (844) In his grand jury testimony, the President recalled that he met with Mr. Jordan on December 19; however, he testified that his memory of that meeting was somewhat vague: I do not remember exactly what the nature of the conversation was. I do remember that I told him that there was no sexual relationship between me and Monica Lewinsky, which was true. And that -- then all I remember for the rest is that he said he had referred her to a lawyer, and I believe it was Mr. Carter. (845) Asked whether he recalled that Mr. Jordan told him that Ms. Lewinsky appeared fixated on him and hoped that he would leave Mrs. Clinton, the President testified: ""I recall him saying he thought that she was upset with -- somewhat fixated on me, that she acknowledged that she was not having a sexual relationship with me, and that she did not want to be [brought] into that Jones lawsuit."" (846) B. December 22: Meeting with Vernon Jordan Mr. Jordan arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to meet with attorney Francis Carter at 11:00 a.m. on Monday, December 22. (847) On that morning, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she called Mr. Jordan and asked to meet before they went to Mr. Carter's office. (848) She testified: ""I was a little concerned. I thought maybe [Mr. Jordan] didn't really understand . . . what it was that was happening here with me being subpoenaed and what this really meant."" (849) She also wanted to find out whether he had in fact told the President of her subpoena. Mr. Jordan said that he had. (850) Ms. Lewinsky also told Mr. Jordan that she was worried that someone might have been eavesdropping on her telephone conversations with the President. (851) When Mr. Jordan asked why she thought that would be of concern, Ms. Lewinsky said, ""Well, we've had phone sex."" (852) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she brought some of her gifts from the President, showed them to Mr. Jordan, and implied that these items were not all of the gifts that the President had given her. (853) Mr. Jordan, in contrast, testified that Ms. Lewinsky never showed him any gifts from the President. (854) C. December 22: First Meeting with Francis Carter Mr. Jordan drove Ms. Lewinsky to Mr. Carter's office. (855) There, he introduced Ms. Lewinsky to Mr. Carter, explaining that she needed not only a lawyer but a ""counselor."" (856) Mr. Carter testified that, after the initial referral, he expected to have no further contact with Mr. Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky or her case. (858) Mr. Carter and Ms. Lewinsky then met for approximately an hour. (859) She explained that she did not want to be drawn into the Jones case and would strongly prefer not to be deposed. (860) He said that he would try to persuade Paula Jones's attorneys not to depose her. (861) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she suggested filing an affidavit to avert a deposition. (862) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she asked Mr. Carter to get in touch with the President's personal attorney, Robert Bennett, just ""to let him know that I had been subpoenaed in this case."" (863) She wanted to make clear that she was ""align[ing] [her]self with the President's side."" (864) Mr. Carter testified that, while Ms. Lewinsky was in his office, he placed a call to Mr. Bennett to arrange a meeting. (865) On the morning of Tuesday, December 23, Mr. Carter met for an hour with two of the President's personal attorneys, Mr. Bennett and Katherine Sexton. (866) The President's attorneys told Mr. Carter that other witnesses had filed motions to quash their subpoenas, and they offered legal research to support such a motion. (867) D. December 23: Clinton Denials to Paula Jones Throughout the sexual harassment case, Ms. Jones's attorneys attempted to obtain information about President Clinton's sexual relationships with any woman other than his wife. On December 11, 1997, the judge overseeing the Jones case, Susan Webber Wright, ruled that the President had to answer a written interrogatory naming every state and federal employee since 1986 with whom he had sexual relations or with whom he had proposed to have sexual relations. On December 23, 1997, the President answered the interrogatory: ""None."" (868) E. December 28: Final Meeting with the President A day or two after Christmas, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie and told her that the President had mentioned that he had presents for her. (869) Ms. Currie called back and told her to come to the White House at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday, December 28. (870) That morning, Ms. Lewinsky met with the President in the Oval Office. WAVES records reflect that the visit was requested by Ms. Currie and that Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 8:16 a.m. (871) After she arrived at the Oval Office, she, the President, and Ms. Currie played with Buddy, the President's dog, and chatted. Then, the President took her to the study and gave her several Christmas presents: a marble bear's head, a Rockettes blanket, a Black Dog stuffed animal, a small box of chocolates, a pair of joke sunglasses, and a pin with a New York skyline on it. (872) Ms. Lewinsky testified that, during this visit, she and the President had a ""passionate"" and ""physically intimate"" kiss. (873) Ms. Lewinsky and the President also talked about the Jones case. (874) In Ms. Lewinsky's account, she asked the President ""how he thought [she] got put on the witness list."" (875) He speculated that Linda Tripp or one of the uniformed Secret Service officers had told the Jones attorneys about her. (876) When Ms. Lewinsky mentioned her anxiety about the subpoena's reference to a hat pin, he said ""that sort of bothered [him], too."" (877) He asked whether she had told anyone about the hat pin, and she assured him that she had not. (878) At some point in the conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the President, ""[M]aybe I should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, maybe Betty."" (879) Ms. Lewinsky recalled that the President responded either ""I don't know"" or ""Let me think about that."" (880) When Ms. Lewinsky was asked whether she thought it odd for the President to give her gifts under the circumstances (with a subpoena requiring the production of all his gifts), she testified that she did not think of it at the time, but she did note some hesitancy on the President's part: [H]e had hesitated very briefly right before I left that day in kind of packaging . . . all my stuff back up . . . I don't think he said anything that indicated this to me, but I thought to myself, ""I wonder if he's thinking he shouldn't give these to me to take out."" But he did. (881) When asked in the Jones deposition about his last meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, the President remembered only that she stopped by ""[p]robably sometime before Christmas"" and he ""stuck [his] head out [of the office], said hello to her."" (882) The deposition occurred three weeks after this December 28 meeting with Ms. Lewinsky. In the grand jury, the President acknowledged ""talking with Ms. Lewinsky about her testimony, or about the prospect that she might have to give testimony. And she, she talked to me about that."" (883) He maintained, however, that they did not discuss Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena: ""[S]he was upset. She -- well, she -- we -- she didn't -- we didn't talk about a subpoena. But she was upset."" (884) In the President's recollection, Ms. Lewinsky said she knew nothing about sexual harassment; why did she have to testify? According to the President, ""I explained to her that it was a political lawsuit. They wanted to get whatever they could under oath that was damaging to me."" (885) Ms. Lewinsky's friend, Catherine Allday Davis, testified about a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky on January 3, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Davis that she had met with the President and discussed the Jones case a few days earlier. Ms. Davis testified that Ms. Lewinsky and the President had ""noted [that] there was no evidence"" of their relationship. (887) E. December 28: Concealment of Gifts In the afternoon of December 28, a few hours after Ms. Lewinsky's White House visit, Ms. Currie drove to Ms. Lewinsky's Watergate apartment and collected a box containing the President's gifts. Ms. Currie then took the box home and hid it under her bed. Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie, and the President were all questioned as to why Ms. Currie retrieved the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the transfer originated in a phone call from Ms. Currie that afternoon. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie said, ""I understand you have something to give me,"" or, ""The President said you have something to give me."" (888) Ms. Lewinsky understood that Ms. Currie was alluding to the gifts. (889) Ms. Currie said that she would stop by Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and pick up the items. (890) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she put many, but not all, of her gifts from the President into a box. Ms. Currie drove by her apartment and picked it up. (891) Ms. Lewinsky was concerned because the gifts were under subpoena; she did not throw them away, however, because ""they meant a lot to [her]."" (892) The reason she gave the gifts to Ms. Currie, and not to one of her friends or her mother, was ""a little bit of an assurance to the President . . . that everything was okay."" (893) She felt that, because the gifts were with Ms. Currie, they were within the President's control: ""Not that [the gifts] were going to be in his possession, but that he would understand whatever it was I gave to Betty and that that might make him feel a little bit better."" (894) Ms. Lewinsky's account of the events of December 28 in her sworn statement of February 1, 1998, corroborates her later grand jury testimony: ""Ms. L . . . asked if she should put away (outside her home) the gifts he had given her or, maybe, give them to someone else. Ms. Currie called Ms. L later that afternoon as said that the Pres. had told her Ms. L. wanted her to hold onto something for her. Ms. L boxed up most of the gifts she had received and gave them to Ms. Currie. It is unknown if Ms. Currie knew the contents of the box."" (895) Ms. Currie's testimony was somewhat at odds with Ms. Lewinsky's. Though her overall recollection was hazy, Ms. Currie believed that Ms. Lewinsky had called her and raised the idea of the gifts transfer. (896) Ms. Currie was asked about the President's involvement in the transfer: Q: And did the President know you were holding these things for Monica? BC: I don't know. I don't know. Q: Didn't he say to you that Monica had something for you to hold? BC: I don't remember that. I don't. Q: Did you ever talk to the President and tell him you had this box from Monica? BC: I don't remember that either. Q: Do you think it happened, though? BC: I don't know. I don't know. (897) When asked whether a statement by Ms. Lewinsky indicating that Ms. Currie had in fact spoken to the President about the gift transfer would be false, Ms. Currie replied: ""Then she may remember better than I. I don't remember."" (898) According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky said that she was uncomfortable retaining the gifts herself because ""people were asking questions"" about them. (899) Ms. Currie said she drove to Ms. Lewinsky's residence after work, collected the box, brought it home, and put it under her bed. (900) Written on the top of the box were the words ""Please do not throw away!!!"" (901) Ms. Currie testified that she knew that the box contained gifts from the President. (902) For his part, the President testified that he never asked Ms. Currie to collect a box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. (903) He said that he had no knowledge that Ms. Currie had held those items ""until that was made public."" (904) The President testified that he has no distinct recollection of discussing the gifts with Ms. Lewinsky on December 28: ""[M]y memory is that on some day in December, and I'm sorry I don't remember when it was, she said, well, what if they ask me about the gifts you have given me. And I said, well, if you get a request to produce those, you have to give them whatever you have."" (905) D. December 31: Breakfast with Vernon Jordan Ms. Lewinsky testified that in late December 1997 she realized that she needed to ""come up with some sort of strategy as to [what to do] if Linda Tripp"" divulged what she knew. (906) On December 30, Ms. Lewinsky telephoned Mr. Jordan's office and conveyed either directly to him or through one of his secretaries that she was concerned about the Jones case. (907) The following day, Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan had breakfast together at the Park Hyatt Hotel. (908) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she told Mr. Jordan that a friend of hers, Linda Tripp, was involved in the Jones case. She told Mr. Jordan: ""I used to trust [Ms. Tripp], but I didn't trust her any more."" (909) Ms. Lewinsky said that Ms. Tripp might have seen some notes in her apartment. Mr. Jordan asked: ""Notes from the President to you?"" Ms. Lewinsky responded: ""No, notes from me to the President."" According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan said: ""Go home and make sure they're not there."" Ms. Lewinsky testified that she understood that Mr. Jordan was advising her to ""throw . . . away"" any copies or drafts of notes that she had sent to the President. (910) After breakfast, Mr. Jordan gave Ms. Lewinsky a ride back to his office. (911) When Ms. Lewinsky returned home to her apartment that day, she discarded approximately 50 draft notes to the President. (912) E. January 4: The Final Gift On Sunday, January 4, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie at home and told her that she wanted to drop off a gift for the President. (913) Ms. Currie invited Ms. Lewinsky to her home, and Ms. Lewinsky gave her the package. (914) The package contained a book entitled The Presidents of the United States and a love note inspired by the movie Titanic . (915) XIII. January 5-January 16, 1998: The Affidavit On January 5, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Francis Carter, drafted an affidavit for Ms. Lewinsky in an attempt to avert her deposition. She spoke with the President that evening. On January 6, Ms. Lewinsky talked to Mr. Jordan about the affidavit, which denied any sexual relations between her and the President. On January 7, Ms. Lewinsky signed the affidavit. On January 8, she interviewed for a job in New York City. After the interview went poorly, Mr. Jordan placed a phone call to the company's chairman on her behalf, and Ms. Lewinsky was given a second interview. The following week, after Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Currie that she would need a reference from the White House, the President asked Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles to arrange one. A. January 5: Francis Carter Meeting At 3:00 p.m. on Monday, January 5, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky met with Mr. Carter at his office for approximately one hour. (916) Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mr. Carter described what a deposition was like and ""threw out a bunch of different questions."" (917) The questions that most concerned her related to the circumstances of her departure from the White House. (918) Mr. Carter told Ms. Lewinsky that he would draft an affidavit for her to sign in hopes of averting her deposition. They arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to pick up a draft of the affidavit the next day. (919) B. January 5: Call from the President After her meeting with Mr. Carter, Ms. Lewinsky sent word via Ms. Currie that she needed to speak to the President about an important matter. (920) Specifically, Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Currie she was anxious about something she needed to sign. (921) A few hours later, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President returned her call. (922) She mentioned an affidavit she would be signing and asked if he wanted to see it. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President responded that he did not, as he had already seen about fifteen others. (923) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told the President that she was troubled by potential questions about her transfer from the White House to the Pentagon. She was concerned that ""people at the White House who didn't like [her]"" might contradict her and ""get [her] in trouble."" (924) The President, according to Ms. Lewinsky, advised her: ""[Y]ou could always say that the people in Legislative Affairs got it [the Pentagon job] for you or helped you get it."" (925) The President acknowledged in the grand jury that he was aware that Ms. Lewinsky had signed an affidavit in early January, but had no specific recollection of a conversation with her in that time period. (926) He testified that he did not recall telling Ms. Lewinsky that she could say, if asked, that persons in the Legislative Affairs Office of the White House had helped her obtain the job at the Pentagon. (927) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President also briefly discussed an antique book that she had dropped off with Ms. Currie the day before. With the book, she enclosed a letter telling the President that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him at least once. (928) In their phone conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the President, ""I shouldn't have written some of those things in the note."" (929) She testified that the President agreed. (930) Although the President had testified in the Jones case that any personal messages from Ms. Lewinsky to him had been ""unremarkable,"" he told the grand jury that he had received ""quite affectionate"" messages from Ms. Lewinsky, even after their intimate relationship ended. (931) The President testified that he cautioned Ms. Lewinsky about such messages: ""I remember telling her she should be careful what she wrote, because a lot of it was clearly inappropriate and would be embarrassing if somebody else read it. I don't remember when I said that. I don't remember whether it was in '96 or when it was."" (932) The President did remember the antique book Ms. Lewinsky had given him, but said he did not recall a romantic note enclosed with it. (933) C. January 6: The Draft Affidavit According to Ms. Lewinsky, in the afternoon of January 6, 1998, she visited Mr. Carter's office and picked up a draft of the affidavit. (934) Later that day, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and Mr. Jordan discussed the draft by telephone. (936) Ms. Lewinsky testified that having Mr. Jordan review the affidavit was like getting it ""blessed"" by the President. (937) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told Mr. Jordan that she was worried about a sentence that implied that she had been alone with the President and thus might incline Paula Jones's attorneys to question her. (938) She eventually deleted it. (939) In addition, Paragraph 8 of the draft affidavit provided in part: I have never had a sexual relationship with the President. . . . The occasions that I saw the President, with crowds of other people , after I left my employment at the White House in April, 1996 related to official receptions, formal functions or events related to the U.S. Department of Defense, where I was working at the time. (941) Deeming the reference to ""crowds"" ""too far out of the realm of possibility,"" (942) Ms. Lewinsky deleted the underscored phrase and wrote the following sentence at the end of this paragraph: ""There were other people present on all of these occasions."" (943) She discussed this proposed sentence, as well as her general anxiety about Paragraph 8, with Mr. Jordan. (944) When questioned in the grand jury, Mr. Jordan acknowledged that Ms. Lewinsky called him with concerns about the affidavit, (945) but maintained that he told her to speak with her attorney. (946) Phone records for January 6 show that Mr. Jordan had a number of contacts with Ms. Lewinsky, the President, and Mr. Carter. Less than thirty minutes after Mr. Jordan spoke by phone to Ms. Lewinsky, he talked with the President for thirteen minutes. Immediately after this call, at 4:33 p.m., Mr. Jordan called Mr. Carter. Less than an hour later, Mr. Jordan placed a four-minute call to the main White House number. Over the course of the day, Mr. Jordan called a White House number twice, Ms. Lewinsky three times, and Mr. Carter four times. (947) Mr. Carter testified that his phone conversations with Mr. Jordan this day and the next ""likely"" related to Ms. Lewinsky and his litigation strategy for her. (948) In fact, Mr. Carter billed Ms. Lewinsky for time for ""[t]elephone conference with Atty Jordan."" (949) When questioned in the grand jury, Mr. Jordan testified that he could not specifically remember the January 6 calls. He said he ""assumed"" that he talked with Ms. Lewinsky about her job search, and he believed that he called Mr. Carter to see ""how he was dealing with this highly emotional lady."" (950) He said that he might have talked with the President about Ms. Lewinsky, but he maintained that ""there [was] no connection"" between his 13-minute conversation with the President and the call he placed immediately thereafter to Mr. Carter. (951) D. January 7: Ms. Lewinsky Signs Affidavit Ms. Lewinsky set an appointment with Mr. Carter to finalize the affidavit for 10 a.m. on January 7, 1998. (952) She signed the affidavit; however, she acknowledged in the grand jury that statements in it were false. (953) Mr. Carter indicated to her that he ""intend[ed] to hold onto this until after I talk to plaintiff's lawyers."" He told her to ""keep in touch,"" and said: ""Good luck on your job search."" (956) According to Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky came to his office on January 7 and showed him the signed affidavit. (957) Over the course of the day, Mr. Jordan placed three calls of significant duration to the White House. (958) He testified: ""I knew the President was concerned about the affidavit and whether it was signed or not."" (959) When asked whether the President understood that the affidavit denied a sexual relationship, Mr. Jordan testified: ""I think that's a reasonable assumption."" (960) According to Mr. Jordan, when he informed the President that Ms. Lewinsky had signed the affidavit, the President said, ""Fine, good."" (961) Mr. Jordan said he was continuing to work on her job, and the President responded, ""Good."" (962) Ten days after this conversation, in the Jones deposition, President Clinton was asked whether he knew that Ms. Lewinsky had met with Vernon Jordan and talked about the Jones case. He answered: I knew he met with her. I think Betty suggested that he meet with her. Anyway, he met with her. I, I thought that he talked to her about something else. I didn't know that -- I thought he had given her some advice about her move to New York. Seems like that's what Betty said. (963) In his grand jury appearance, however, President Clinton testified that Mr. Jordan informed ""us"" on January 7 that Ms. Lewinsky had signed an affidavit to be used in connection with the Jones case. (964) The President defended his deposition testimony by stating: [M]y impression was that, at the time, I was focused on the meetings. I believe the meetings he had were meetings about her moving to New York and getting a job. I knew at some point that she had told him that she needed some help, because she had gotten a subpoena. I'm not sure I know whether she did that in a meeting or a phone call. And I was not, I was not focused on that. I know that, I know Vernon helped her get a lawyer, Mr. Carter. And I, I believe that he did it after she had called him, but I'm not sure. But I knew that the main source of their meetings was about her move to New York and her getting a job. (965) E. January 8: The Perelman Call The day after she signed the affidavit, January 8, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky interviewed in New York with Jaymie Durnan, Senior Vice President and Special Assistant to the Chairman at MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc. (MFH). (966) Mr. Durnan testified that, although impressive, Ms. Lewinsky was not suited for any MFH opening. (967) He told her that he would pass on her resume to Revlon, an MFH company. (968) Ms. Lewinsky called Mr. Jordan and reported that she felt that the interview had gone ""very poorly."" (969) Mr. Jordan indicated in response that ""he'd call the chairman."" (970) At 4:54 p.m., Mr. Jordan called Ronald Perelman, chairman and chief executive officer of MFH. (971) Mr. Jordan told the grand jury with respect to Mr. Perelman, one ""[c]an't get any higher -- or any richer."" (972) Asked why he chose to call Mr. Perelman, Mr. Jordan responded: ""I have spent a good part of my life learning institutions and people, and, in that process, I have learned how to make things happen. And the call to Ronald Perelman was a call to make things happen, if they could happen."" (973) According to Mr. Perelman, Mr. Jordan spoke of ""this bright young girl, who I think is terrific,"" and said that he wanted ""to make sure somebody takes a look at her."" (977) Mr. Perelman testified that, in the roughly twelve years that Mr. Jordan had been on Revlon's Board of Directors, he did not recall Mr. Jordan ever calling to recommend someone. (978) After he spoke with Mr. Perelman, Mr. Jordan telephoned Ms. Lewinsky and told her, ""I'm doing the best I can to help you out."" (982) Ms. Lewinsky soon received a call from Revlon, inviting her to another interview. (984) Over the course of January 8, Mr. Jordan placed three calls to the White House -- twice to a number at the White House Counsel's Office, once to the main White House number. (985) As to the Counsel's Office calls, Mr. Jordan speculated that he was trying to reach Cheryl Mills, Deputy White House Counsel, to express his ""frustration"" about Ms. Lewinsky. (986) According to Mr. Jordan, Ms. Mills knew who Ms. Lewinsky was: ""[T]hat was no secret, I don't think, around the White House, that I was helping Monica Lewinsky."" (987) F. January 9: ""Mission Accomplished"" On the morning of Friday, January 9, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky interviewed with Allyn Seidman, Senior Vice President of MFH, and two individuals at Revlon. (988) Ms. Lewinsky testified that the interviews went well and that Ms. Seidman called her back that day and ""informally offered [her] a position, and [she] informally accepted."" (989) Ms. Lewinsky then called Mr. Jordan and relayed the good news. (990) When shown records of a seven-minute call at 4:14 p.m., Mr. Jordan testified: ""I have to assume that if she got the job and we have a seven-minute conversation and the day before I had talked to the chairman [Ronald Perelman], I have to assume the Jordan magic worked."" (991) According to Mr. Jordan, he believed that he notified Ms. Currie and the President as soon as he learned that Ms. Lewinsky had obtained an offer: ""I am certain that at some point in time I told Betty Currie, 'Mission accomplished.'"" (992) Mr. Jordan testified that he also told the President directly that, ""'Monica Lewinsky's going to work for Revlon,' and his response was, 'Thank you very much.'"" (993) G. January 12: Pre-Trial Hearing in Jones Case On January 12, 1998, Judge Wright held a hearing in the Jones case to discuss pre-trial issues, including the President's upcoming deposition. (994) At that hearing, Judge Wright required Ms. Jones's counsel to list all the witnesses that they planned to call at trial. Ms. Jones's witness list named many women, among them Ms. Lewinsky, to support her theory that the President had a pattern of rewarding women based on their willingness to engage in sexual relations with him. At the hearing, Judge Wright indicated that she would permit Ms. Jones to call as witnesses some of the women she listed in support of her case. H. January 13: References from the White House On Tuesday, January 13, 1998, Jennifer Sheldon, Manager of Corporate Staffing of Revlon, called Ms. Lewinsky and formally extended her a position as a public relations administrator. Asked whether this was a relatively quick hiring process, Ms. Sheldon responded, ""In totality of how long open positions normally stay open, yes. This was pretty fast."" (995) Ms. Sheldon told Ms. Lewinsky that she needed to send her some references. (996) According to Ms. Lewinsky, she then called Ms. Currie because she was ""concerned that if I put [Mr. Hilley] down as a reference, he might not say flattering things about me."" (997) At 11:11 a.m. on January 13, Ms. Currie paged Ms. Lewinsky and left the following message: ""Will know something this afternoon. Kay."" (998) That day, January 13, the President talked with Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles about a reference for Ms. Lewinsky. (999) The President told Mr. Bowles that Ms. Lewinsky ""had found a job in the . . . private sector, and she had listed John Hilley as a reference, and could we see if he could recommend her, if asked."" Mr. Bowles assured the President that Mr. Hilley would give Ms. Lewinsky a recommendation commensurate with her job performance. (1000) Thereafter, Mr. Bowles took the President's request to Mr. Podesta, the Deputy Chief of Staff, who in turn spoke with Mr. Hilley. (1001) Mr. Hilley responded that, because he did not know Ms. Lewinsky personally, he would have his office write a recommendation. (1002) It would be a generic letter, simply confirming the dates of employment, because of the less than favorable circumstances surrounding Ms. Lewinsky's departure from the White House. (1003) Ms. Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie called later that day and told her that ""Mr. Podesta took care of it and everything would be fine with Mr. Hilley."" (1004) At 11:17 a.m. the next day, Wednesday, January 14, Ms. Lewinsky faxed her acceptance to Revlon and listed John Hilley and her Defense Department supervisor as references. (1006) The President was asked in the grand jury whether he ever spoke to Mr. Bowles about obtaining a reference from Mr. Hilley for Ms. Lewinsky. He testified that he did, at Ms. Lewinsky's request, although he thought he had done so earlier than January 13 or 14. (1007) I. January 13: Final Jordan Meeting According to Ms. Lewinsky, on Tuesday, January 13, she stopped by Mr. Jordan's office to drop off some thank-you gifts for helping her find a job. Ms. Lewinsky offered to show him a copy of her signed affidavit in the Jones case, but he indicated that he did not need to see it. (1008) J. January 13-14: Lewinsky-Tripp Conversation and Talking Points In a face-to-face conversation on January 13, Ms. Lewinsky told Linda Tripp: ""This is what my lawyer taught me. You really don't -- you don't very often say 'no' unless you really need to. The best is, 'Well, not that I recall, not that I really remember. Might have, but I don't really remember.'"" (1009) Ms. Lewinsky said that, if asked in a deposition, ""Were you ever alone with the President?"" she could say, ""Um, it's possible I may have taken a letter on the weekend, but, you know -- I might have, but I don't really. . . ."" (1010) Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp then discussed the situation: Ms. Lewinsky: I don't think the way that man thinks, I don't think he thinks of lying under oath. . . . Ms. Tripp: Yes, he is because he's the one who said, ""Deny, deny, deny."" Of course he knows. Ms. Lewinsky: Right. But it's -- hard to explain this. It's like -- (sigh) Ms. Tripp: You know what I mean. I mean, I don't know -- do I think he is consciously -- Ms. Lewinsky: If-- if -- if I said, if somebody said to him, ""Is Monica lying under oath,"" he would say yes. But when he on his own thinks about it, he doesn't think about it in those terms. Okay? Ms. Tripp: Probably. Ms. Lewinsky: Okay? He thinks of it as, ""We're safe. We're being smart."" Okay? ""We're being smart, we're being safe, it's good for everybody."" (1011) On January 14, Ms. Lewinsky gave Ms. Tripp a three-page document regarding ""points to make in [Ms. Tripp's] affidavit."" (1012) Ms. Lewinsky testified that she wrote the document herself, although some of the ideas may have been inspired by conversations with Ms. Tripp. (1013) K. January 15: The Isikoff Call In the grand jury, Betty Currie testified that on Thursday, January 15, 1998, she received a telephone call from Michael Isikoff of Newsweek , who inquired about courier receipts reflecting items sent by Ms. Lewinsky to the White House. (1014) Ms. Currie called Mr. Jordan and asked for guidance in responding to Mr. Isikoff's inquiry because, in her words, she had a ""comfort level with Vernon."" (1015) After Ms. Currie arranged to meet with Mr. Jordan at his office, (1016) Ms. Lewinsky drove her there. (1017) Mr. Jordan confirmed in the grand jury that Ms. Currie expressed concern about a call from Mr. Isikoff. (1018) He invited her to his office but advised her to ""talk to Mike McCurry and Bruce Lindsey . . . because I cannot give you that advice."" (1019) In a recorded conversation that day, January 15, Ms. Lewinsky encouraged Ms. Tripp not to disclose her (Lewinsky's) relationship with the President. Ms. Lewinsky tried to persuade Ms. Tripp to lie by telling her that others planned to lie: ""I'm not concerned all that much anymore because I'm not going to get in trouble because you know what? The story I've signed . . . under oath is what someone else is saying under oath."" When Ms. Tripp asked, ""Who?"" Ms. Lewinsky responded: ""He will,"" referring to the President. (1020) Ms. Lewinsky stated that she did not think the President would ""slip up"" at his deposition because she was not a ""big issue"" like Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. In contrast, she regarded herself as nothing more than ""rumor and innuendo."" (1021) One of Ms. Lewinsky's friends, Natalie Ungvari, testified that, when Ms. Lewinsky was implicated in the Jones case, ""it seemed to me that Monica was just confident everybody would say the right thing, that everything would be orchestrated to come out a secret."" (1022) L. January 15-16: Developments in the Jones Law Suit On January 15, 1998, President Clinton's counsel served Ms. Jones's attorneys with the President's responses to Ms. Jones's document requests. (1023) One of the requests specifically sought all documents reflecting communications between the President and Monica Lewinsky. (1024) President Clinton objected to the scope of this request, but, notwithstanding his objection, he stated that he did not have any responsive documents. Also on January 15, Mr. Carter drafted a motion to quash the subpoena issued by Paula Jones's attorneys to Ms. Lewinsky. Attached to the motion was Ms. Lewinsky's signed affidavit. (1025) At the request of Katherine Sexton, one of the President's personal attorneys, Mr. Carter faxed a copy of the affidavit to her law offices. Mr. Carter testified that he asked Ms. Sexton why she needed the affidavit that day: I said, ""Well, Katie, you're going to get it tomorrow because I'm filing it, and it's going to be attached as an exhibit to the motion."" She said, ""Well, but you've already provided it to the other side, so can I get a copy"" -- words to that effect. I said, ""I have no problem."" And so I faxed it to her. (1026) On January 16, 1998, Mr. Carter arranged for the overnight delivery of the motion to quash and the accompanying affidavit to Judge Susan Webber Wright's law clerk and Paula Jones's attorneys. (1027) XIV. January 17, 1998-Present: The Deposition and Afterward The President was asked a number of questions about Ms. Lewinsky during his January 17, 1998, deposition in the Jones case. In sworn testimony, the President denied having a sexual affair or sexual relations with her. That evening, the President called Ms. Currie and asked her to meet him the following day to discuss Ms. Lewinsky. After allegations that the President had an affair with a White House intern became public, the President emphatically denied the reports to aides and to the American public. A. January 17: The Deposition On Saturday, January 17, 1998, the President testified under oath at a deposition in the Jones case. (1028) Judge Susan Webber Wright traveled from Little Rock, Arkansas, to preside at the deposition in Washington, D.C. (1029) Prior to any questions, Judge Wright reminded the parties about her standing Protective Order. She specifically stated: ""[I]f anyone reveals anything whatsoever about this deposition, . . . it will be in violation of the Protective Order. This includes the questions that were asked, . . . You may acknowledge that [the deposition] took place, but that is it."" (1030) Judge Wright accepted the following definition of the term ""sexual relations:"" For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in ""sexual relations"" when the person knowingly engages in or causes . . . contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person . . . . ""Contact"" means intentional touching, either directly or through clothing. (1031) After the President had answered a few questions about Ms. Lewinsky, his attorney, Robert Bennett, urged Judge Wright to limit further inquiries. Mr. Bennett stated that Ms. Lewinsky had executed an affidavit ""saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind of any manner, shape or form, with President Clinton."" (1032) When Judge Wright cautioned Mr. Bennett not to make remarks that ""could be arguably coaching the witness,"" Mr. Bennett represented to Judge Wright: ""In preparation of the witness for this deposition, the witness is fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing he doesn't know . . . ."" (1033) President Clinton, who was present when Mr. Bennett made his objection, did not contradict his attorney's comment. Rejecting Mr. Bennett's argument, Judge Wright permitted the questioning about Ms. Lewinsky to continue. (1034) Over the course of extensive questioning, the President testified that he had seen Ms. Lewinsky ""on two or three occasions"" during the government shutdown in the fall of 1995, including one occasion when she brought pizza to him, and one or two other occasions when she delivered documents to him. (1035) He could not recall whether he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky on such occasions, although he acknowledged that it was possible. (1036) The President further testified that he could not remember the subject of any conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. (1037) President Clinton recalled that he received only a couple of unremarkable personal messages from Ms. Lewinsky, and he could not recall ever having received a cassette tape from her. (1038) He received presents from her ""[o]nce or twice"" -- a book or two and a tie. (1039) The President originally testified that he could not recall any gifts he might have given her; later in the deposition, however, he remembered that some merchandise he had purchased from a Martha's Vineyard restaurant might have reached her through Ms. Currie. (1040) The President stated that he might have given Ms. Lewinsky a hat pin, though he could not recall for certain. (1041) The President testified that his last conversation with Ms. Lewinsky had been before Christmas, when she had visited the White House to see Ms. Currie. The President stated: ""I stuck my head out, said hello to her."" (1042) He said it was also possible that, during that encounter, he had joked with Ms. Lewinsky that the plaintiff's attorneys were going to subpoena ""every woman I ever talked to"" and Ms. Lewinsky ""would qualify."" (1043) The President testified that he was unaware that Mr. Jordan had talked with Ms. Lewinsky about the Jones case, in which she had also been subpoenaed to testify at a deposition. (1044) The President emphatically denied having had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. (1045) At the conclusion of the deposition, Judge Wright said: ""Before [the President] leaves, I want to remind him, as the witness in this matter, and everyone else in the room, that this case is subject to a Protective Order regarding all discovery, . . . and . . . all parties present, including . . . the witness are not to say anything whatsoever about the questions they were asked, the substance of the deposition, . . . any details, . . . and this is extremely important to this Court."" (1046) Sometime after the President's deposition, Mr. Podesta saw Bruce Lindsey, Deputy White House Counsel, at the White House and inquired how the deposition went. According to Mr. Podesta, Mr. Lindsey said that the President had been asked about Monica Lewinsky. (1047) Mr. Lindsey testified that, during a break in the President's deposition, the President had told him that Ms. Lewinsky's name had come up. (1048) That same evening, Mr. Lindsey met with the President in the Oval Office, where they discussed the deposition. (1049) Mr. Lindsey, relying on the attorney-client, presidential communication, deliberative process, and work-product privileges, declined to say what specifically was discussed at this meeting. B. The President Meets with Ms. Currie Soon after the deposition, the President called Ms. Currie and asked her to come to the White House the next day. (1050) Ms. Currie acknowledged that, ""It's rare for [the President] to ask me to come in on Sunday."" (1051) The President wanted to discuss Ms. Lewinsky's White House visits. (1052) At approximately 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, January 18, 1998, Ms. Currie met with the President. (1053) The meeting took place at her desk outside the Oval Office. According to Ms. Currie, the President appeared ""concerned."" (1054) He told Ms. Currie that, during his deposition the previous day, he had been asked questions about Monica Lewinsky. (1055) Ms. Currie testified: ""I think he said, 'There are several things you may want to know.'"" (1056) He proceeded to make a series of statements, (1057) one right after the other: (1058) ""You were always there when she was there, right?"" ""We were never really alone."" ""Monica [Lewinsky] came on to me, and I never touched her, right?"" ""You can see and hear everything, right?"" (1059) Ms. Currie testified that, based on his demeanor and the way he made the statements, the President wanted her to agree with them. (1060) Ms. Currie testified that she did, in fact, agree with the President when he said, ""You were always there when she was there, right?"" (1063) Before the grand jury, however, Ms. Currie acknowledged the possibility that Ms. Lewinsky could have visited the President when she was not at the White House. (1064) With respect to whether the President was ""never really alone"" with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie testified that there were several occasions when the President and Ms. Lewinsky were either in the Oval Office or in the study without anyone else present. (1065) Ms. Currie explained that she did not consider the President and Ms. Lewinsky to be ""alone"" on such occasions because she was at her desk outside the Oval Office; accordingly, they were all together in the same ""general area."" (1066) Ms. Currie testified that ""the President, for all intents and purposes, is never alone. There's always somebody around him."" (1067) As to whether Ms. Lewinsky ""came on"" to him, Ms. Currie testified that she ""would have no reason to know"" whether Ms. Lewinsky ever ""came on"" to the President because Ms. Currie was not present all the time. (1068) Finally, as to whether she ""could see and hear everything,"" Ms. Currie testified that she should not have agreed with the President. (1069) She testified that when the President and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together in the study, while Ms. Currie was at her desk, she could ""hear nothing."" (1070) The President also made the following statement during their January 18, 1998 meeting, according to Ms. Currie: ""[Monica Lewinsky] wanted to have sex with me, but I told her I couldn't do that."" (1071) When the President was questioned about this meeting with Ms. Currie in the grand jury, he testified that he recalled the conversation, but he denied that he was ""trying to get Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful."" (1072) Rather, the President testified that he asked a ""series of questions"" in an effort to quickly ""refresh [his] memory."" (1073) The President explained: ""I wanted to establish . . . that Betty was there at all other times in the complex, and I wanted to know what Betty's memory was about what she heard, what she could hear . . . . [a]nd I was trying to figure [it] out . . . in a hurry because I knew something was up."" (1074) In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that, ""in fairness,"" Ms. Currie ""may have felt some ambivalence about how to react"" to his statements. (1075) The President maintained that he was trying to establish that Ms. Currie was ""always there,"" and could see and hear everything. (1076) At the same time, he acknowledged that he had always tried to prevent Ms. Currie from learning about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. (1077) ""[I] did what people do when they do the wrong thing. I tried to do it where nobody else was looking at it."" (1078) The President was also asked about his statement that Ms. Currie was always in the Oval Office when Ms. Lewinsky visited. He explained that he may have intended the term ""Oval Office"" to include the entire Oval Office complex. (1079) The President further explained, ""I was talking about 1997. I was never, ever trying to get Betty Currie to claim that on the occasions when Monica Lewinsky was there when she wasn't anywhere around, that she was."" (1080) When asked whether he restricted his remarks to the year 1997, the President responded, ""Well, I don't recall whether I did or not, but . . . I assumed [Ms. Currie] knew what I was talking about."" (1081) When questioned about his statement to Ms. Currie, ""you could see and hear everything,"" the President responded: My memory of that was that, that she had the ability to hear what was going on if she came in the Oval Office from her office. And a lot of times, you know, when I was in the Oval Office, she just had the door open to her office. Then there was -- the door was never completely closed to the hall. So, I think there was -- I'm not entirely sure what I meant by that, but I could have meant that she generally would be able to hear conversations, even if she couldn't see them. And I think that's what I meant. (1082) Finally, when asked about his statement to Ms. Currie that ""Monica came on to me and I never touched her,"" the President refused to answer. (1083) C. January 18-19: Attempts to Reach Ms. Lewinsky In the wake of her Sunday afternoon session, Ms. Currie paged Ms. Lewinsky four times. (1084) She testified that the President ""may have asked me to call [Ms. Lewinsky] to see what she knew or where she was or what was happening."" (1085) Later that evening, at 11:02 p.m., the President called Ms. Currie to ask whether she had spoken to Ms. Lewinsky. (1086) Over a two-hour span the next morning, Monday, January 19, 1998, Ms. Currie made eight unsuccessful attempts to contact Ms. Lewinsky, by either pager or telephone. (1087) After speaking with the President to let him know that she was unable to reach Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie again paged her. (1091) The purpose of these calls, according to Ms. Currie, was to tell Ms. Lewinsky that her name had been mentioned in the President's deposition. (1092) Mr. Jordan also tried unsuccessfully to reach Ms. Lewinsky that morning. (1094) That afternoon, Mr. Jordan met with the President in the Oval Office. (1095) Later, Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Frank Carter, called Mr. Jordan and told him that Ms. Lewinsky had obtained new counsel, William Ginsburg and Nathaniel Speights. (1096) Mr. Jordan passed this information on to the President that evening in a seven-minute phone conversation. (1097) D. January 20-22: Lewinsky Story Breaks After the publication of an article alleging a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, President Clinton conferred with his attorneys and issued a number of denials to his aides and to the American public. 1. ""Clinton Accused"" On Wednesday, January 21, 1998, the Washington Post published a story entitled ""Clinton Accused of Urging Aide to Lie; Starr Probes Whether President Told Woman to Deny Alleged Affair to Jones's Lawyers ."" (1098) The White House learned the essentials of the Post story on the night of January 20, 1998. (1099) President Clinton placed a number of phone calls that night and the following morning. (1100) From 12:08 a.m. to 12:39 a.m., he spoke with his personal attorney, Robert Bennett. Mr. Bennett would be quoted in the Post article as saying, ""The President adamantly denies he ever had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and she has confirmed the truth of that."" (1101) He added: ""This story seems ridiculous and I frankly smell a rat."" (1102) Immediately after his call to Mr. Bennett, President Clinton called Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey; they spoke for about half an hour, until 1:10 a.m. (1103) At 1:16 a.m., the President called Ms. Currie at home and spoke to her for 20 minutes. Ms. Currie testified that the President was concerned that her name was mentioned in the Post article. (1104) Soon after this call, the President called Mr. Lindsey. (1105) A few hours later, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the President called Mr. Jordan in New York City to tell him, according to Mr. Jordan, that the Post story was untrue. (1106) From 7:14 a.m. to 7:22 a.m., the President spoke again with Mr. Lindsey. (1107) Responding to the Post story that day, the White House issued a statement, personally approved by the President, declaring that he was ""outraged by these allegations"" and that ""he has never had an improper relationship with this woman."" White House spokesperson Mike McCurry said that the statement ""was prepared by the Counsel's office, and I reviewed it with the President to make sure that it reflected what he wanted me to say . . . He looked at it, and he said fine. . . . It was prepared in consultation between the lawyers and the President. The Counsel's Office gave it to me. I wanted to, of course, verify that that's exactly what the President wanted me to say."" (1108) 2. Denials to Aides According to Mr. Lindsey, the remainder of the morning was spent in a series of meetings about the Lewinsky matter, including preparing the President for anticipated Lewinsky-related questions in three previously scheduled media interviews. (1109) At these meetings, President Clinton denied the allegations to several of his top aides. The President met with Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, along with his two deputies, John Podesta and Sylvia Matthews. According to Mr. Bowles, the President told them, ""I want you to know I did not have sexual relationships with this woman, Monica Lewinsky. I did not ask anybody to lie. And when the facts come out, you'll understand."" (1110) The President made a similar denial that morning to Harold Ickes, his former Deputy Chief of Staff. (1111) The President also discussed the matter with Ms. Currie for a second time. (1112) According to Ms. Currie, the President called her into the Oval Office and gave a ""sort of a recapitulation of what we had talked about on Sunday -- you know, 'I was never alone with her' -- that sort of thing."" (1113) The President spoke with the same tone and demeanor that he used during his previous session with her. (1114) Ms. Currie testified that the President may have mentioned that she might be asked about Ms. Lewinsky. (1115) Later that day, the President summoned Sidney Blumenthal to the Oval Office. They spoke for about 30 minutes. (1116) The President said to Mr. Blumenthal, ""I haven't done anything wrong."" (1117) Mr. Blumenthal testified that the President told him, ""Monica Lewinsky came on to me and made a sexual demand on me."" The President said that he ""rebuffed her."" (1119) The President also told Mr. Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky had ""threatened him. She said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the stalker any more."" (1120) Mr. Blumenthal then asked the President whether he and Ms. Lewinsky were alone when she threatened him. The President responded, ""Well, I was within eyesight or earshot of someone."" (1121) According to Mr. Blumenthal, the President complained: ""I feel like a character in a novel. I feel like somebody who is surrounded by an oppressive force that is creating a lie about me and I can't get the truth out. I feel like the character in the novel Darkness at Noon ."" (1122) Soon thereafter, in the course of a meeting about the progress of the President's State of the Union address, the President made a second denial of the allegations to Mr. Podesta. (1123) Mr. Podesta testified: [H]e said to me that he had never had sex with her, and that -- and that he never asked -- you know, he repeated the denial, but he was extremely explicit in saying he never had sex with her . . . . Well, I think he said -- he said that -- there was some spate of, you know, what sex acts were counted, and he said that he had never had sex with her in any way whatsoever -- that they had not had oral sex. (1124) The President was asked during his grand jury appearance whether he recalled denying a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to his senior aides and advisors, including Mr. Bowles, Mr. Podesta, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Ickes, and Mr. Jordan. (1126) The President did not recall specific details but did remember the following: I met with certain people, and [to] a few of them I said I didn't have sex with Monica Lewinsky, or I didn't have an affair with her or something like that. I had a very careful thing I said, and I tried not to say anything else . . . . I remember that I issued a number of denials to people that I thought needed to hear them, but I tried to be careful and to be accurate. * * * And I believe, sir, that -- you'll have to ask them what they thought. But I was using those terms in the normal way people use them. (1127) The President testified that he had said ""things that were true about this relationship. That I used -- in the language I used, I said, there's nothing going on between us. That was true. (1128) I said I did not have sex with her as I defined it. That was true."" (1129) The President qualified this answer, however: ""I said things that were true. They may have been misleading, and if they were I have to take responsibility for it, and I'm sorry."" (1130) 3. Initial Denials to the American Public On the afternoon of January 21, the President made his first of a series of previously scheduled media appearances. In an interview on National Public Radio's ""All Things Considered,"" the following colloquy took place: Q: Mr. President, . . . . [m]any Americans woke up to the news today that the Whitewater independent counsel is investigating an allegation that you . . . encouraged a young woman to lie to lawyers in the Paula Jones civil suit. Is there any truth to that allegation? WJC: No, sir, there's not. It's just not true. Q: Is there any truth to the allegation of an affair between you and the young woman? WJC: No. That's not true either. . . . The charges are not true. And I haven't asked anybody to lie. (1131) That evening, the President appeared on the PBS program ""The News Hour with Jim Lehrer."" He was asked again whether the allegation of an affair with a White House intern was true. The President replied, ""That is not true. That is not true. I did not ask anyone to tell anything other than the truth. There is no improper relationship. And I intend to cooperate with this inquiry. But that is not true."" When asked to define what he meant by the term ""improper relationship,"" the President answered, ""Well, I think you know what it means. It means that there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship, or any other kind of improper relationship."" (1132) The following morning, on January 22, 1998, the President again denied he had done anything improper. Speaking at a televised White House photo opportunity with Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the President stated: ""[T]he allegations are false, and I would never ask anybody to do anything other than tell the truth. That is false."" (1133) The President also gave an interview to Roll Call that day. He stated: ""[T]he relationship was not improper, and I think that's important enough to say. . . . But let me answer -- it is not an improper relationship and I know what the word means. . . . The relationship was not sexual. And I know what you mean, and the answer is no."" (1134) At each of these interviews, the President pledged he would cooperate fully with the investigation. On NPR, the President stated: ""I have told people that I would cooperate in the investigation, and I expect to cooperate with it. I don't know any more about it, really, than you do. But I will cooperate. . . . I'm doing my best to cooperate with the investigation."" (1135) To Mr. Lehrer, he said: ""[W]e are doing the best to cooperate here, but we don't know much yet. . . . I think it's important that we cooperate, I will cooperate, but I want to focus on the work at hand."" (1136) In his photo opportunity with Mr. Arafat, the President stated: [T]he American people have a right to get answers. We are working very hard to comply, get all the requests for information up here. And we will give you as many answers as we can, as soon as we can, at the appropriate time, consistent with our obligation to also cooperate with the investigations. And that's not a dodge; that's really what I've -- I've talked with our people. I want to do that. I'd like for you to have more rather than less, sooner rather than later. So we will work through it as quickly as we can and get all those questions out there to you."" (1137) Finally, in his Roll Call interview, the President vowed: ""I'm going to cooperate with this investigation. . . . And I'll cooperate."" (1138) 4. ""We Just Have To Win"" Amidst the flurry of press activity on January 21, 1998, the President's former political consultant, Dick Morris, read the Post story and called the President. (1139) According to Mr. Morris, he told the President, ""You poor son of a bitch. I've just read what's going on."" (1140) The President responded, Mr. Morris recalled, ""Oh, God. This is just awful. . . . I didn't do what they said I did, but I did do something. I mean, with this girl, I didn't do what they said, but I did . . . do something (1141) . . . . And I may have done enough so that I don't know if I can prove my innocence. . . . There may be gifts. I gave her gifts, . . . . [a]nd there may be messages on her phone answering machine."" (1142) Mr. Morris assured the President, ""[t]here's a great capacity for forgiveness in this country and you should consider tapping into it."" (1143) The President said, ""But what about the legal thing? You know, the legal thing? You know, Starr and perjury and all. . . . You know, ever since the election, I've tried to shut myself down. I've tried to shut my body down, sexually, I mean. . . . But sometimes I slipped up and with this girl I just slipped up."" (1144) Mr. Morris suggested that he take a poll on the voters' willingness to forgive confessed adultery. The President agreed. (1145) Mr. Morris telephoned the President later that evening with the poll results, which showed that the voters were ""willing to forgive [the President] for adultery, but not for perjury or obstruction of justice[.]"" (1146) When Mr. Morris explained that the poll results suggested that the President should not go public with a confession or explanation, he replied, ""Well, we just have to win, then."" (1147) The President had a follow-up conversation with Mr. Morris during the evening of January 22, 1998, when Mr. Morris was considering holding a press conference to ""blast Monica Lewinsky 'out of the water.'"" (1148) The President told Mr. Morris to ""be careful"". According to Mr. Morris, the President warned him not to ""be too hard on [Ms. Lewinsky] because there's some slight chance that she may not be cooperating with Starr and we don't want to alienate her by anything we're going to put out."" (1149) Meanwhile, in California, the President's good friend and Hollywood producer, Harry Thomason, had seen the President's interview with Jim Lehrer on televison. (1150) Mr. Thomason, who had occasionally advised the President on matters relating to the media, traveled to Washington, D.C., and met with him the next day. (1151) Mr. Thomason told the President that ""the press seemed to be saying that [the President's comments were] weak"" and that he, Mr. Thomason, ""thought his response wasn't as strong as it could have been."" (1152) Mr. Thomason recommended that the President ""should explain it so there's no doubt in anybody's mind that nothing happened."" (1153) The President agreed: ""You know, you're right. I should be more forceful than that."" (1154) In the ensuing days, the President, through his Cabinet, issued a number of firm denials. On January 23, 1998, the President started a Cabinet meeting by saying the allegations were untrue. (1155) Afterward, several Cabinet members appeared outside the White House. Madeline Albright, Secretary of State, said: ""I believe that the allegations are completely untrue."" The others agreed. ""I'll second that, definitely,"" Commerce Secretary William Daley said. Secretary of Education Richard Riley and Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala concurred. (1156) The next day, Ann Lewis, White House Communications Director, publicly announced that ""those of us who have wanted to go out and speak on behalf of the president"" had been given the green light by the President's legal team. (1157) She reported that the President answered the allegations ""directly"" by denying any improper relationship. She believed that, in issuing his public denials, the President was not ""splitting hairs, defining what is a sexual relationship, talking about 'is' rather than was. (1158) You know, I always thought, perhaps I was naive, since I've come to Washington, when you said a sexual relationship, everybody knew what that meant."" Ms. Lewis expressly said that the term includes ""oral sex."" (1159) * * * On Monday, January 26, 1998, in remarks in the Roosevelt Room in the White House, President Clinton gave his last public statement for several months on the Lewinsky matter. At an event promoting after-school health care, the President denied the allegations in the strongest terms: ""I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again: I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These allegations are false."" (1160) 1.

The other, T22, is a telephone conversation between Ms. Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky, recorded by Ms. Tripp. From these and other transcripts of recorded conversations, the OIC has redacted various brief, irrelevant, and gratuitous passages, mostly references to Ms. Lewinsky's family members. Most of these redactions are only a word or two long; others are somewhat longer. The tapes themselves have not been edited by the OIC, and the OIC will provide unredacted transcripts if the House of Representatives so requests. Ms. Tripp produced to the OIC 27 tapes (four of which proved inaudible or blank) of her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Tripp testified that she turned over the original recordings. She testified that she knew nothing about any duplications of the recordings, though others had access to or control over the tapes at times before they were turned over. According to a preliminary FBI examination, several of the 23 tapes containing audible conversations exhibit signs of duplication, and one tape exhibiting signs of duplication was produced by a recorder that was stopped and restarted during the recording process. These preliminary results raise questions about the reliability and authenticity of at least one recording, which in turn raise questions about the accuracy of Ms. Tripp's testimony regarding her handling of the tapes. The OIC is continuing to investigate this matter. This Referral does not quote or rely on any tapes that exhibit signs of duplication. For a fuller discussion, see Appendix, Tab I. 127.

A draft of Ms. Lewinsky's thank-you note (to ""Dear Mr. P"") was found in her apartment. It says in part: All of my life, everyone has always said that I am a difficult person for whom to shop, and yet, you managed to choose two absolutely perfect presents! A little phrase (with only eight letters) like ""thank you"" simply cannot begin to express what I feel for what you have given me. Art & poetry are gifts to my soul! I just love the hat pin. It is vibrant, unique and a beautiful piece of art. My only hope is that I have a hat fit to adorn it (ahhh, I see another excuse to go shopping)! I know that I am bound to receive compliments on it. I have only read excerpts from ""Leaves of Grass"" before -- never in its entirety or in such a beautifully bound edition. Like Shakespeare, Whitman's writings are so timeless. I find solace in works from the past that remain profound and somehow always poignant. Whitman is so rich that one must read him like one tastes a fine wine or good cigar -- take it in, roll it in your mouth, and savor it! I hope you know how very grateful I am for these gifts, especially your gift of friendship. I will treasure them all . . . always. MSL-DC-00000621 - 622 (emphasis in original) (ellipsis in original).

(1061) 1061. Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 69-76; Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 6-16. Ms. Currie did alter a statement that she previously made to the FBI agents shortly after the events in question. Ms. Currie explained that the President's statement to her that, ""She wanted to have sex with me, and I can't do that,"" appeared simply intended as a statement, not a statement he wanted Ms. Currie to agree with.

Indeed, she testified that, at some point after January 18, she heard that Ms. Lewinsky visited the Oval Office on Saturdays, one of her days off. Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 65-66. 1065. Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 32-33; 36-38. 1066. Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 12, 15-6; Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 76. 1067. Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 14. The President, apparently, had a similar understanding of ""alone."" Before the grand jury, the President explained that ""when I said, we were never alone, right . . . I meant that she [Ms. Currie] was always in the Oval Office complex, in that complex, while Monica was there."" Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 132. Elsewhere in her testimony, Ms. Currie appeared to have a different understanding of ""alone."" She testified that, on one occasion, because others observed Ms. Lewinsky in the Oval Office complex, Ms. Currie accompanied Ms. Lewinsky into the Oval Office, where the President was working. Ms. Currie explained that she waited in the dining room while Ms. Lewinsky and the President met in the study so ""[t]hey would not be alone."" Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 130. See also Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 56 (""I asked her specifically . . . to remain in the dining room, Betty, while I met with Monica in my study.""). Ms. Currie testified that she did not want people who had observed Ms. Lewinsky enter the Oval Office to think that she and the President were ""alone."" Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 132. 1068. Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 79. Ms. Currie testified: ""The way the question was phrased to me at the time, I answered, 'Right.' It seemed to me that was the correct answer for me to give . . . the '[c]ome on to me,' I considered that more of a statement as opposed to a question."" Id. at 80. 1069.

He had not had a sexual relationship with her, and had not sought to obstruct justice or suborn perjury."" (1118) 1118. Blumenthal 6/26/98 at 26. 1119. Blumenthal 6/4/98 GJ at 49.

The President made another misleading statement about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to Mr. Podesta a few weeks later. According to Mr. Podesta, ""[h]e said to me that after she [Ms. Lewinsky] left [the White House], that when she had come by, she came by to see Betty, and that he -- when she was there either Betty was with them -- either that she was with Betty when he saw her or that he saw her in the Oval Office with the door open and Betty was around -- and Betty was out at her desk.""

The President responded: ""I'm not saying that anybody who had a contrary memory is wrong. I do not remember."" Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 105. 1128. In claiming that this statement was true, the President was apparently relying on the same tense-based distinction he made during the Jones deposition.

He declined all of these invitations. On July 16, 1998, the grand jury issued the President a subpoena. The President promptly moved for a postponement of two weeks in which to respond. At a hearing on the President's motion, Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson stated, ""What we need to do is to move forward and move forward expeditiously. . . .

A queda acumulada das acções, desde Janeiro, já vai em 35 % Renato Santos Arquivo DN EXPECTATIVA. PT liderada por Murteira Nabo revela hoje contas semestrais O pessimismo continua bem vivo no espírito dos investidores portugueses. Ao contrário das restantes praças europeias, que ontem recuperaram parte das quebras da véspera, a Bolsa de Lisboa sofreu elevadas perdas. O índice PSI-20 tocou no nível mais baixo desde Junho de 1997 (6 660,34 pontos), encerrando com quebra de mais 2,93 %. Desde Janeiro a desvalorização acumulada é de 35 %. Os operadores e analistas contactados pelo DN afirmaram que Lisboa deslizou mais do que as restantes bolsas europeias porque na sessão anterior tinha tido uma queda mais modesta. Outro factor foi a fraca liquidez, pois o volume de negócios não foi além dos 20 milhões de contos. A sessão ficou marcada por uma nova chuva de mínimos, das 20 empresas do PSI-20, 12 fixaram novos recordes anuais ou históricos. A PT foi o papel mais negociado, tendo caído 5,82 %, penalizado pela ausência de compradores e também pela incerteza quanto aos sresultados semestrais que serão hoje conhecidos. Uma poll de sete analistas estima que a operadora lucrou entre 31,8 e 42,7 milhões de contos, intervalo que se situa abaixo dos 57,3 milhões de contos alcançados no mesmo período do ano passado. As maiores quedas do PSI-20 pertenceram às tecnológicas PT Multimédia (9,9 %), Novabase (8,31 %) e Impresa (7,22 %). A EDP desceu também 2,5 % e o BCP e a Brisa recuaram também 1,5 % e 1,3 %, respectivamente. Sonae.com e Cimpor foram os únicos papéis que escaparam à onda negra da Bolsa. Sonae SGPS compra um milhão de acções próprias A Sonae SGPS adquiriu na segunda-feira um milhão de acções próprias, passando a deter 110 551 000, correspondentes a 10,23 % do capital, anunciou a empresa em comunicado. A compra foi feita em dois lotes, um de 438 298 acções, ao preço unitário de 0,60 euros; e outro de 561 702 acções, a 0,61 euros cada, num investimento total de 605,6 milhões de euros (121,29 mil contos). As acções atingiram ontem 0,55 euros (110 escudos), sendo este o título mais transaccionado. Copyright © 1995,2001 Diário de Notícias, SA Todos os direitos reservados webmaster@DnOnline"

Quase igual à Expo. Porque como lembra o autor do Plano de Urbanização da Expo, Vassalo Rosa, a Exposição Mundial de Lisboa foi construída a pensar na cidade definitiva. Assim, com a excepção da Área Internacional Sul e da zona dos restaurantes a norte, já lá está quase tudo. Depois o que não está, ainda não se sabe como vai ser, pela simples razão que dentro do recinto não há nenhum projecto de arquitectura licenciado. Assim, a grande surpresa vão ser os cerca de 50 lotes da Área Internacional Sul. Fora do recinto, na zona de intervenção, a situação é quase a mesma, há poucos projectados licenciados, para além dos que já estão construídos. O que se conhece - e vê nas projecções a três dimensões amplamente divulgadas - é apenas a volumetria dos edifícios definida pelos quatro planos aprovados. E ainda faltam aprovar dois, nesta nova parte da cidade, que prevê atrair 23 mil habitantes e 18 mil trabalhadores em 2010. Pavilhão de Portugal Até 31 de Dezembro, poderão ficar o restaurante e a livraria, no compasso de espera para o começo das obras de readaptação do edifício para aí instalar a sede do Governo - a Presidência do Conselho de Ministros. O centro da exposição, o filme ""A Viagem"" baseado no biombos Nanban, só poderá ser exibido se a maquinaria alugada para o projectar continuar no recinto. O espólio arqueológico da nau ""Nossa Senhora dos Mártires"", que não foi exposto na totalidade, regressará ao Centro Nacional de Arqueologia Subaquática, onde terá o destino que o Ministério da Cultura lhe quiser dar.   Edifício Nau, restaurantes e passeio flutuante O Edifício Nau e o passeio flutuante são estruturas que continuarão a fazer parte da marina. Durante a fase de reestruturação do recinto, o Edifício Nau continuará em funcionamento, permitindo ao público frequentar os mesmos bares e restaurantes que o ocuparam durante o período Expo, pelo menos até ao final do ano. Em Janeiro, o edifício apresentará pequenas remodelações mas continuará a ser uma área de restauração. O restaurante Nobre, à semelhança de outros, já assegurou um arrendamento de 30 anos. Diogo Pinto Gonçalves, director-delegado da Marina Expo, empresa concessionária da marina, afirma que a maioria dos espaços já se encontram vendidos. Ligado ao Edifício Nau vai nascer uma nova estrutura comercial que será igualmente ocupada por bares e restaurantes - a Ponte Cais. Com interessados em fila, as negociações para manter os restaurantes flutuantes continuam, sem certezas. Quanto ao passeio flutuante sabe-se já que um pequeno troço será utilizado para fechar a bacia sul da marina. A Exibição Náutica continuará a ser um espaço de animação enquanto palco de regatas e exposições. Pavilhão do Conhecimentos dos Mares O pavilhão do Conhecimento dos Mares na Expo-98 vai tornar-se no Espaço de Descoberta Científica de Lisboa, um centro de ciência especialmente dedicado às crianças. Da responsabilidade do Ministério da Ciência e da Tecnologia (MCT), o projecto está agora numa fase de definição de conteúdos, para que possa arrancar no próximo ano com um programa próprio de exposições. A adaptação do edifício do Pavilhão do Conhecimento dos Mares para um futuro espaço de divulgação científica obrigará à construção de um auditório que, segundo uma proposta apresentada no Verão passado ao MCT, ""poderia ocupar a parte baixa na nave (...), sendo o custo aproximado desta obra de 96 mil contos"". Torre Vasco da Gama O Clube T, concessionário por um período de 15 anos, vai assegurar a exploração do restaurante panorâmico como até aqui. No entanto, a magnífica vista sobre o rio não será um exclusivo das bolsas de luxo. O miradouro instalado na Torre Vasco da Gama permanecerá aberto ao público. Quem quiser subir ao varandim só tem de pagar os habituais 500$00. Quanto ao espaço anteriormente ocupado pelo Pavilhão da União Europeia nada está decidido. Teatro Camões O teatro, que se torna um dos grandes auditórios disponíveis na cidade, reabre a 16 de Outubro. A 1 de Janeiro será entregue ao Ministério da Cultura para albergar a Orquestra Sinfónica de Lisboa e a Companhia Nacional de Bailado. Não será sala de espectáculo permanente para nenhuma das entidades - a Sinfónica continua ligada ao Teatro S. Carlos -, mas a companhia de dança tenderá a utilizá-la como o seu palco mais regular. Até ao final do ano, o teatro, que reabrirá com a gala da Food Agriculture Organization, poderá repor ""D. Giovanni"", de Mozart, com encenação de Pedro Wilson, um dos espectáculos do Festival dos 100 Dias. Teleférico O teleférico continuará a ser uma varanda sobre o Mar da Palha. O preço está ainda em estudo. A Telecabines de Lisboa, empresa responsável pelo teleférico durante a Expo, assegurará o serviço pelo menos até 2012. Pavilhão Multiusos O Pavilhão da Utopia cessou ontem funções, com a última apresentação do espectáculo ""Oceanos e Utopias"", e passou a Pavilhão Multiusos. Durante o mês de Outubro, é tempo de desmontar a complexa estrutura que serviu o espectáculo e adaptar palco e plateia. A agenda da maior sala de espectáculos do país (com capacidade para cerca de 26 mil pessoas) já tem 10 marcações até ao fim do ano e vai desde concertos - Massive Attack, no dia 10 de Novembro, e Bauhaus, quatro dias depois (com bilhetes que podem custar 4.000$00) - às festas de Natal e Ano Novo para empresas. As entradas serão pagas consoante o tipo de espectáculo a realizar. Para 99, há planos para que possa ser utilizado para desportos, sobretudo radicais (motocross, karting, BTT e escalada), aquáticos (windsurf e jet-ski) e desportos de inverno (pistas de snowboard e um ringue de patinagem sobre o gelo). Para Julho está já marcada a fase final do campeonato do mundo de juniores de basket. Pavilhão do Território O pavilhão reabre a 16 de Outubro exactamente como está e continuará a servir para apresentações, reuniões e seminários do Ministério do Planeamento. Visitável todos os dias, das 10h às 19h, o preço de entrada no pavilhão será de 300 escudos, mas os jovens até aos 18 anos e os maiores de 65 anos têm entrada gratuita. A estrutura física do pavilhão será depois desmontado e poderá ir para o Porto ou para o Alentejo, neste último caso como espaço para a juventude. Pavilhão da Realidade Virtual O pavilhão pertença da Portugal Telecom (PT) irá ficar pelo menos até 31 de Dezembro deste ano. Quem quiser descer durante uma hora até à estação arqueológica submarina Oceânia terá que pagar mil escudos. Os descontos vão continuar para crianças até 12 anos e seniores. Mas vai tornar-se um pavilhão ""vespertino"": só estará aberto das 14h às 20h e encerra um dia por semana - ao fim-de-semana o horário poderá ser alargado. Nas 12 sessões diárias de 30 em 30 minutos entrarão cerca de 40 pessoas de cada vez. A única alteração é a substituição do espectáculo do videoglobo no hall da PT por um novo conteúdo desligado de qualquer marca. Trata-se de um projecto interactivo que articula as facetas tecnológica, científica e didáctica da realidade virtual. Pavilhão da ViniPortugal A Expo convidou a ViniPortugal a permanecer no recinto com o seu pavilhão, mas transformando-o numa loja de vinhos ou num ""wine bar"". O único problema é que se trata de uma associação de promoção, sem fins comerciais e, de acordo com os seus estatutos, não pode explorar um espaço desta natureza. Pavilhão de Macau O pavilhão de Macau é talvez o que mais propostas tem recebido para o pós-31 de Dezembro de 1998. A Walt Disney foi a primeira instituição a demonstrar interesse, mas outras possibilidades - mais lógicas - são a permanência do pavilhão na zona de Lisboa, perto da actual localização, ou a transferência para um parque urbano noutro local do país. Por enquanto, o espaço vai ficar tal como está até 31 de Dezembro, inclusivé com a animação nos jardins. Ainda não está definido o preço a pagar pela entrada mas será um valor simbólico, a rondar a média das poucas centenas de escudos. O restaurante, também localizado na zona norte, ficará durante o mesmo tempo que o pavilhão, embora já existam propostas para permanecer em 1999. A lorcha Macau é hoje entregue à Associação Aporvela. Pavilhão do Futuro Ainda subsistem algumas dúvidas quanto à permanência do pavilhão mais ""científico"" do recinto. Estão a ser analisadas as condições para a continuação da projecção do filme a três dimensões. A confirmar-se esta permanência, o bilhete de entrada deverá rondar os 500 escudos. O horário será das 10h às 18h, com um dia de folga semana - que ainda não está definido mas será o mesmo para todos os pavilhões temáticos. Pavilhão da Madeira O pavilhão deverá continuar até ao fim do ano. Por enquanto ainda não há qualquer decisão quanto à cobrança de entradas. Embora a empresa defenda a opção da entrada livre, a última palavra caberá ao Governo Regional. O espaço poderá ser visitado das 10h às 17h. O conteúdo expositivo sofrerá algumas alterações porque a maior parte das obras de arte são emprestadas. Para as substituir os responsáveis já elaboraram uma lista de novas peças. Oceanário de Lisboa A jóia da coroa reabrirá a 16 de Outubro, ficando com uma equipa de 60 a 70 pessoas e Paulo Serra Lopes como director. A entrada para adulto terá um preço entre 1700 e dois mil escudos e o visitante verá quatro vezes mais do que viu até agora. Abrem as quatro galerias multimédia - onde haverá, por exemplo, uma câmara subaquática no tanque dedicado ao Oceano Índico, comandada por um ""joy stick"" -, as exposições temporárias, cuja primeira, já em Outubro, terá como tema o oceanógrafo Luís Saldanha. Estarão lá mais painéis informativos e 16 pequenas salas com sofás para os visitantes contemplarem demoradamente os aquários. De meia hora a visita passa a demorar uma hora e meia a duas horas. Ou o tempo que quiser. Fragata D. Fernando A fragata ""D. Fernando II e Glória"" vai abandonar a marina na primeira semana de Outubro. Apesar de se terem efectuado negociações no sentido de a manter no Cais Português, a fragata será instalada num local ainda a determinar pela Administração do Porto de Lisboa. Na opinião do Museu da Marinha, entidade a que a fragata pertence, a permanência no cais não é possível devido à ausência de condições de segurança e ao afastamento das estruturas administrativas, tanto do porto como do próprio museu. À semelhança do que estava previsto, a fragata irá funcionar como navio-museu, podendo ser visitado por 400$00 (preço de adulto). Antes de ocupar um lugar definitivo no Porto de Lisboa, a fragata irá passar pela Base Naval para efectuar trabalhos de manutenção, necessários depois de ter recebido cerca de 900.000 visitantes. Espaços Verdes A manutenção dos espaços verdes que estão espalhados pelo recinto vai ficar a cargo da empresa constituída para a gestão urbana da zona de intervenção. Assim sendo, a manutenção, quase certa, dos exóticos Jardins Garcia de Orta e a conclusão dos sete hectares do Parque do Cabeço das Rolas será da responsabilidade desta entidade que resulta do protocolo assinado pela Parque Expo e pelas câmaras de Lisboa e Loures. O projecto para o Parque Urbano do Tejo e Trancão está ainda em discussão. Os Jardins da Água e o Relvado das Ondas deverão continuar a oferecer ao público um merecido descanso à beira rio. Centro de Comunicação Social O edifício onde funcionaram algumas das estruturas de apoio à comunicação social não tem ainda dono, embora a sua permanência no futuro parque urbano esteja já assegurada. A dificuldade em encontrar um interessado reside na especificidade da organização do próprio espaço. Os meios técnicos que sustentavam a Tele Expo passarão para a RTP e o material dos estúdios de rádio será vendido. Gare do Oriente e Centro Comercial Vasco da Gama A Gare do Oriente será o ponto de partida para a ligação Lisboa-Porto efectuada pelos modernos comboios pendulares, em 2 horas e 15 minutos, a partir de 2001. Por baixo da gare funcionará o centro comercial Vasco da Gama e surgirão dois edifícios de 33 andares cada (24 dos quais de habitação), propriedade da Sonae. Uma das torres, a S. Gabriel, já se encontra praticamente vendida, segundo a Sonae. O centro comercial, com 170 lojas, uma área de diversões e 10 salas de cinema, deverá abrir no próximo ano. Área Internacional Norte Depois dos 60 dias para retirar os conteúdos dos pavilhões dos países instalados na Área Norte do recinto, os 100.000 metros quadrados deste espaço serão entregues à Associação Industrial Portuguesa. O novo parque de exposições da FIL, que incluirá um centro de reuniões, restaurantes e cafetarias, será inaugurado a 13 de Março com a abertura da Nauticampo, com uma nova fachada (falsa) virada ao rio. O destino da Praça Sony e dos bares adjacentes não está ainda decidido. A Parque Expo tem todo o interesse que a estrutura do vídeo-estádio se mantenha nos próximos anos. O futuro o dirá. Área Internacional Sul Os países participantes terão 60 dias para retirar os conteúdos dos pavilhões. Depois será tempo de desmantelar as estruturas que serão vendidas e reaproveitadas para utilizações tão diversas como estruturas museológicas, ginásios ou simples armazéns. O terreno - cerca de 5 hectares - sofrerá obras de conclusão das infra-estruturas como redes de esgotos, electricidade, gás e água. Expo Adrenalina A Expo-Adrenalina fechou definitivamente. A sua principal atracção, o ""skycoaster"", propriedade de uma empresa americana, vai sair do país. As condições atmosféricas não permitiriam que continuasse a funcionar nos mesmos moldes. Mas a Adrenalina já demonstrou interesse, junto da Parque Expo, de criar, a partir de Janeiro de 1999, um projecto de raiz para uma nova estrutura radical na zona. Alameda e vulcões A Alameda dos Oceanos ficará tal e qual nos habituámos a vê-la durante a Expo. Com árvores, flores, iluminação, tanques com ondas artificiais e os famosos vulcões de água. E também a irregular calçada. Mas por agora, as torneiras vão ser fechadas para se fazerem obras de manutenção, porque os mergulhos e a natação nos tanques destruíram muitos azulejos do revestimento. As gigantescas torres com publicidade também se mantêm. Até ao final do ano, a gestão e funcionamento de todas estas estruturas serão asseguradas pela Parque Expo. Depois disso, ficarão à guarda da empresa tripartida constituída pela parque Expo em conjunto com as câmaras de Lisboa e Loures. Portas Os torniquetes das quatro portas começam a ser retirados já hoje mas as estruturas dos edifícios podem ser utilizadas como estão até 31 de Dezembro. A excepção é a Porta do Sol - que serve a Gare do Oriente -, encerrada devido ao início das obras do Centro Comercial da Sonae. (c) Copyright PÚBLICO Comunicação Social, SA Email: publico@publico.pt"
